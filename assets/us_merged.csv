This tiny, minimally adorned space filled with old-fashioned charm is better for twosomes than groups. While the menu may be petite, it's full of fresh fare like a light and flavorful Dungeness crab ""burger"" on a sesame bun; Caesar salad combining sweet prawns and tangy anchovy dressing; or a cup of creamy Boston clam chowder loaded with fresh clams and potatoes. As the name portends, raw oysters are a specialty, so fresh and briny that the accompanying mignonette may not be necessary.

CA,"180 Rutherford Hill Rd., Rutherford 94573",Californian,American,Auberge du Soleil,$$$$,4.7,"The approach to this wine country destination, tucked into a tiny hill among steep winding roads and famed wineries, is a treat in itself. Every corner of the building oozes warmth-even the terrace (kept toasty with space heaters) and its spectacular views overlooking that patchwork of vines and pine forests. The classy and very cozy dining room boasts a wood-burning fire and a natural color scheme that flows from the rattan chairs and pumpkin-colored embroidered linens to the terra-cotta walls. Servers are equally warm, professional, and courteous. The sophisticated clientele (many of them guests of the hotel) seem to be relishing this as an escape from their busy and prosperous daily lives. Still, the cooking trumps the setting with near-flawless preparations of seasonal, California-inspired cuisine. Begin with delicate gnocchi that promise to just melt in the mouth, swimming in a pungent, meaty parmesan and mushroom nage along with chopped pea shoots and sautéed wild mushrooms. Superlative entrées may feature succulent bay scallops, their sweetness offset by lemony roasted cauliflower, all surrounded by a pearly ribbon of prosciutto.

Not really, when one considers how rare solid cooking and sane prices can be in this tony burg. The cozy space has two seating options: a gleaming marble counter as well as tables that stretch from front to back (the ones up front are lighter, airier, and more preferable). The food is thoughtful and refined with a daily rotating risotto, house-stretched mozzarella and burrata, and glorious pastas like ricotta fazoletti with a deeply flavored Bolognese. Grilled octopus salad with potatoes, olives, and tomato dressing is boosted by prime ingredients and careful seasoning.

But California's lighter side is here, too: a salad of silken smoked trout and frisée is garden-fresh, and daily specials highlight the best in local produce. The classic bistro accoutrements (yellow walls, wooden tables, framed retro posters) are present and accounted for, but there's an element of quirky fun here as well-from the flower-bedecked bicycle out front to the porcelain hens and hogs that dot the dining room.

The food spans cultural influences, including a delicate risotto with pine nuts in a cauliflower broth, or soy-sesame glazed halibut atop whipped potatoes and braised kale.

Some prefer the counter to soak up the sizzle from the open kitchen. Playful American cuisine is their dictum which shines through in tuna carpaccio-an homage to Italian antipasto-here starring tissue-thin slices of tuna served with citrusy mizuna and creamy mustard sauce.

Dining here is gorgeous; some find the service personalities to be pompous, while others regard them as warm and convivial. However, the blaring 80's soundtrack (if indeed that is your era) keeps the mood lively. One thing that is undeniable is the level of extraordinary skill and detail that Chef Joshua Skenes uses to craft each item on his spontaneous menu. Expect cultured butters and cream, light and infused broths, as well as the smoke of a wood-fired oven to feature prominently. Meals may highlight luscious white sturgeon caviar with crisp potatoes tourné and a dab of cultured cream. Then, sample sweet, tender lobster barely warmed over coals with a savory seaweed dressing and rich lobster-brain sauce. Dry-aged duck is grilled ""near the fire,"" served with giblet-confit ragù, wood-roasted date, a dark jus, and is absolutely delicious.",3.0,112.5,4.0

Get the party started with dahi vada (crispy fried lentil fritters buried in smooth yogurt), before savoring a basil-chutney dosa starring a crisp rice-lentil crêpe stuffed with potato masala and served with basil chutney as well as an ultra-spicy ghost chili version-to be risked by hardcore hotheads only. Each plate is carefully composed, as shown in the complex Andhra chicken curry, enriched with coconut and bobbing with tender dark meat.

It's all part of the restaurant's ramshackle appeal (as are the ultra-affordable prices). Even if poultry's not your thing, the menu's other offerings are well worth the effort it takes to eat here: dry-fried prawns are tossed in a sweet-and-spicy chili-garlic sauce, and hot and salty twice-cooked pork is fried with a heap of bell peppers and dried red chilies.

Chef Lahlou's food retains the influence of his Moroccan upbringing, with dishes like duck confit basteeya rolled in thin sheets of flaky pastry. However, diners can also look forward to new levels of creativity using ingredients from around the globe. Even a simple dish of carrots gets unexpected heft from meaty dates and crunchy pecans, not to mention a hit of spice from urfa pepper. Then a wreath of eggplant packs a punch of texture and flavor into one beautiful dish; while tender, smoky octopus, served in a spicy lamb merguez broth with chickpea purée, is Californian and Moroccan all at once. The visionary chef's attention to detail extends to the exceptional drinks.

Outstanding, gracious servers only add to the pleasure. Two menus are offered in this dining room: an eight-course exploration into NorCal-centric seasonal fare, or a 17-course chef's tasting loaded with luxurious global ingredients. Both exhibit thoughtful technique, from supremely fresh abalone over creamy polenta and cured squab to golden-crusted halibut with parsnip purée, lobster, and chanterelle mushrooms.

Austrian cuisine is known for being hearty and immeasurably satisfying, but the great strength of Wallsé is that you don't have to have spent the day skiing in Innsbruck to appreciate its cuisine because the adept kitchen has a lightness of touch and is not rigidly tied to tradition. Whether you've chosen the loin of venison with bone marrow or have gone for the tafelspitz, you'll find the dishes are nicely balanced and effortlessly easy to eat.

Sit in the main dining room where all the action happens, rather than in the alcove off the bar-which is undoubtedly-Siberia. As the name suggests, seafood and shellfish lie at the heart of the menu. And needless to say, the ingredients are not only of irreproachable quality but are also treated with respect and deftness by the kitchen, whether it's the brilliant white halibut or the salt-baked wild bass. Start with the crudo, and then head for a generous bowl of homemade pasta such as tagliolini with clams and calamari, followed by a whole fish or a classic entrée. It's not of course compulsory to stick to fish-the lamb chops make a worthy alternative. The wine list is a deserving tome and along with the big names are some lesser known growers who merit investigation.",2.0,112.5,4.0

George Mendes' cheerfully run restaurant may not necessarily transport you there but you will leave here feeling as though your serotonin levels have received a timely boost. Those who like to eat whilst deciding what to eat should head straight for the appealing Portuguese selection of petiscos, or snacks-the croquetas de bacalhau and the Serrano ham are good. The main menu is seasonally pertinent and full of dishes to match that southern European climate: they are bright, sunny, and you feel they are doing you good. Nothing says the Med more than sardines-and here they come expertly filleted and dressed with dill and bronzed fennel. But even when the sun's gone down, the kitchen is equally adept at more warming, comforting dishes-try the venison with Swiss chard and chestnuts. The restaurant comes decorated with birch wood and shades of blue and is spread over two narrow rooms. Thanks to the open kitchen, the first floor has more buzz but if you're on a date, ask for the mezzanine level which is a little more intimate.",1.0,62.0,3.0

Here, Chef César Ramirez-the bespectacled authoritarian-stands center stage, surrounded by sous chefs and state-of-the-art everything. He personally welcomes every guest to his ""table"" which is actually a gleaming steel counter surrounding his kitchen, where each copper pot is watched-over and every porcelain vessel is cooled or warmed to match the temperature of the food it holds. The bar for painstaking detail seems to rise with each dish. Expect a bang of flavor to open your meal, perhaps with a tart layering briny sea trout roe. Signatures like sea urchin piled over toasted brioche with a round of Périgord truffle never lose their impact. However, what was once an endless parade of seafood bites from faraway shores has grown and refined into equally lush mini-entrées. A square of Miyagi beef is whoa-inducing. Tiny wild strawberries, yogurt ice cream, and sake gelée balance each element with wondrous intensity.

The large bar exudes class and fun, with two antique jhoolas (swings) crafted from Burmese teak. Then, walk through a 200-year-old wooden arch and carved panels beyond, seemingly afloat in a reflecting pool, to enter the amber-tinted dining room where tables are luxuriously spaced. The kitchen is patently ambitious and quite successful in presenting a contemporary vision of Indian cuisine. Every dish is thoughtfully composed and highlights only products of top quality. Begin with a thick octopus tentacle sent to the tandoor, emerging crisped, charred, incredibly tender, and served with pickled purple potato as well as herb oil. Murg lababdar tastes of pure elegance in seared and braised de-boned chicken drenched in a sweetly spiced, deeply flavored tomato-onion gravy.

In place of the seizure-inducing colored lighting, this midtown favorite offers billowing muslin and neutral tones; and instead of the usual Bollywood clichés, it provides tranquil, sophisticated surroundings, and attentive, sweet natured service. The menu is also markedly different from the norm. For the appetizers, the kitchen takes the sort of snacks you can find streetside on Chaupati and, by putting its own spin on them (and using primary ingredients), raises them to new heights-such as with the white beans of ragda chaat, which is a great way to start your meal. You can also go Goan for some Portuguese influence with the succulent shrimp balchao. But, be sure to leave room for authentic goat biryani served on the bone, or something from the tandoor like those tender lamb chops. As a nod to local tastes, spicing can be a little timid but those who are familiar with India-and anyone who knows their silly mid-on from their backward point-will still find much to savor.",1.0,37.0,3.0

This isn't the place for sushi-you go next door for that. Instead, it serves seasonally pertinent dishes that are a joy to behold, but where the art never comes at the expense of taste.

Delicate ricotta gnocchi with toasted hazelnuts showcases spring's sweet peas and pickled ramps, while golden spotted tile fish is seared and plated with squid ink Hollandaise, saffron broth, rice beans, and braised artichokes.

A strong Asian accent is woven throughout the menu, which also hails inspiration from Australia's Greek and Italian immigrants. Moist seaweed combined with avocado, snake beans, and roasted red pepper is a pop of flavors, brightened by a soy sauce- and toasted sesame oil-dressing.

The proper dining room in the back is where the highly recommended tasting menu is served. This reasonably priced prix-fixe stimulates with small bites like sardine conserva served on buttered crostini with shaved radish; and may be followed by softly scrambled eggs drizzled with ruby shrimp jus, or seared lamb loin with greenmarket produce and crushed black olives.

You'll even notice his Austrian roots in evidence in some of the dishes, such as short rib and tafelspitz terrine, or the Granny Smith and sweetbread strudel. The room is comfortable and neat and the atmosphere grown-up yet animated.

Although it's spacious with plenty of outdoor options, the popular spot doesn't accept reservations-and has the lines to prove it. Executive Chef/partner Neil Kleinberg (also of downtown fave Clinton St. Baking Company) turns out joyful fare, and the weekly blueberry pancake special is just one reason why this place gets so much love. For lunch, a kale salad with artichoke hearts, pickled carrots, and crispy chickpeas is anything but rote. Come dinnertime, the fish or steak of the day has revealed pan-seared mahi-mahi with roasted cauliflower and black truffle beurre blanc, or grilled strip steak brushed with glistening teriyaki.",0.0,37.0,2.0

The pretty space is illuminated with jewel-toned votives and boasts a cement floor inlaid with oak, straw seat chairs, and exposed brick. Beyond this, the chef puts her impressive experience to work in the open kitchen. The house-made pappardelle is a perfect example of Miranda's unique approach: the wide delicate strands of pasta clutch on to bits of slow-cooked lamb in a dark, earthy, mole tasting of dried chilies, sweet spices, and bitter chocolate.

Here, the staff speaks their mother tongue for the most part, incense wafts from an altar, and the food is otherworldly. Dishes present dazzling, authentic flavors, easily savored in the peaceful atmosphere. Sweet, head-on shrimp arrive steamed and still in the shell, housing juice that accentuates the concentrated flavor when dipped in soy sauce. Likewise, the stinky tofu (a traditional delicacy) gets its flavor from a light sauté and a finish of kimchi-style pickles.

Popular choices include roti telur, a thin and slightly crisped yet pliable pancake stuffed with scrambled eggs, onions, and peppers, paired with fragrant chicken curry and coconut dipping sauce.
