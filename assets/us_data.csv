Noodle Pudding,0.0,"With Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra rotating on the playlist and a dark wood bar full of regulars, Noodle Pudding embodies all the essential qualities of a winning neighborhood spot. It's the type of place to kick back and relax, dine on consistently good food, and even sit solo but never feel ""alone."" The kitchen has mastered Italian-American classics, with honest ingredients and great preparation, like the balance of acidic and sweet components in the gently poached cod Livornese. The tantalizing eggy-cheesy, slightly smoky-sweet, and creamy carbonara that bathes toothsome mezze rigatoni, fava beans, and tiny pork sausage meatballs is ""dyno-mite."" Top it all off with the exemplary (and shareable) house-made cheesecake and a perfect shot of espresso.",Italian,"38 Henry St., New York 11201",37.0,NY,4.3,118,2,54,0,0,37.0,11201
Peter Luger,1.0,"Venerated Peter Luger resides in an expansive space reminiscent of old New York and early German ale houses-an endless line of visitors only serves to reiterate how special a place this truly is. Add to that a series of imposing pane windows, wood-paneled walls, and decorative old steins, and find yourself utterly smitten. Begin with thrillingly fatty, thick-cut bacon nearly sweet on the outside, or shrimp cocktail in a rich tomato dressing. But, what truly leaves diners speechless is that delightfully succulent Porterhouse for two, three, or four. These slabs of beautifully naked meat are simple but their marbling is a thing of complexity and perfection, sizzling in drippings. The wedge salad sets a new standard: it is an enormous and crisp slice of iceberg drowned in blue cheese dressing, chopped tomato, and more bacon. The carnivorous feast is complete when sanctified by crispy French fries or excellent creamed spinach. Properly prepped servers are cordial, yet informal and never chatty. A hunk of NY cheesecake, creamy, tart, and served with schlag, is every bit as classic as one imagines. Equally marvelous and dressed to the nines is a ""Holy cow sundae""-the title speaks for itself.",Steakhouse,"178 Broadway, New York 11211",112.5,NY,4.2,911,4,99,1,1,112.5,11211
Gnocco,0.0,"A casual cucina with a lovely back garden, Gnocco is a neighborhood staple with a homey touch. The restaurant charms with creaky wood floors and exposed brick walls accented by abstract paintings. The wood-burning oven at the entrance sets a warm tone, and greets guests with the heady aroma of freshly baked bread. The signature gnocco (sweet, salty pillows of fried bread) can be ordered as an appetizer, side, or even as a dessert with Nutella. Pizzas shine on this carb-centric menu, thanks to that blistered thin crust hanging over the plate's edge. The Amatriciana layers tart tomato sauce with sweet red onion, shreds of pancetta, and a heavy-handed sprinkle of red pepper flakes. The torta cioccolato with chocolate mousse makes a fine dessert.",Italian,"337 E. 10th St., New York 10009",37.0,NY,3.9,72,2,82,0,0,37.0,10009
Hasaki,0.0,"Since the mid-eighties, this local darling has been going strong thanks to its high quality ingredients, skilled kitchen, and excellent value. For under $20, the soba lunch set will warm the heart of any frugal fan of Japanese cuisine. This generous feast features a bowl of green tea noodles in hot, crystal-clear dashi stocked with wilted water spinach and fish cake, accompanied by lean tuna chirashi, yellowtail, and kanpyo. The ten-don, a jumbo shrimp tempura served over rice, is just as enticing. The à la carte offerings draw crowds seeking delish sushi as well as a host of tasty cooked preparations; a Twilight menu is nice for early birds. The dining room has a clean and spare look, with seating available at a number of wood tables or sizable counter.",Japanese,"210 E. 9th St., New York 10003",37.0,NY,4.2,63,2,55,0,0,37.0,10003
Hearth,0.0,"After more than a decade delighting fans, Chef Marco Canora and his dining room still have what it takes to impress Manhattan's fickle diners. The space remains fresh and welcoming, and the chef has added an adjacent bone broth kiosk, Brodo, which has converts lining up for their daily fix. Italian classics given a creative reworking are the key to Hearth's longtime success. Baccalà is used to compose roasted cod scattered with crisped bits of skin, silky chickpea purée, and garlic confit. Then veal-and-ricotta meatballs wrapped in slow-cooked tomato sauce are nestled in stone-ground polenta that is prepared cacio e pepe-style. And, desserts here are as enticing as the wines. Imagine a warm autumn fruit crisp, complete with pecan streusel and honey gelato.",Mediterranean,"403 E. 12th St., New York 10009",62.0,NY,4.2,102,3,32,0,0,87.25,10009
Kanoyama,0.0,"Offering an impressive lineup of excellent quality and deftly prepared fish, this popular and permanently packed sushi den is housed in a space that may be simply decorated but is spotless and well-maintained. The kitchen's focus here is on a parade of pristine cuts that are bolstered by a passage of daily items such as rich baby shad from Japan and tender, mild American white bonito. Also find a generous listing of plump, briny oysters; starters such as wakasagi tempura (fried baby smelts) sprinkled with green tea-salt; and a handful of cooked entrées. The value-conscious omakase is highly recommended. Besides being tempting, the website is very informative: it presents diverse fish facts, photos, and recommendations for seasonality and preparation.",Japanese,"175 Second Ave., New York 10003",37.0,NY,4.1,88,2,55,0,0,37.0,10003
Rocking Horse Cafe,0.0,"A Chelsea classic since 1988, this Mexican café has a split personality. The front room-with vibrant orange walls, glowing lanterns, bare tabletops, and a long bar-is a bright, casual place to sample tequila cocktails or crunch into handmade tortilla chips and smoky salsa. Beyond a blue mosaic wall, the back room is a down-to-earth dining spot with a relaxed feel.The distinctive menu includes the likes of cordero enchipotlado, chipotle braised lamb shank with caramelized onions, roasted tomatoes, and epazote over a creamy bed of cotija-spiked polenta; or blue corn crepas de pato stuffed with duck confit. The wise diner who ventures beyond commonplace dishes here is rewarded with complex, from-scratch cooking with soul.",Mexican,"182 Eighth Ave., New York 10011",37.0,NY,4.0,137,2,66,0,0,37.0,10011
Paradou,0.0,"For a restaurant that refuses to take itself too seriously, the crowd-pleasing bistro cuisine here is no joke. At home along a cobblestoned street in the clubby Meatpacking District, Paradou offers a handful of tables and a stocked bar. Move past the vintage French liquor ads and down a brick-lined hallway to find a year-round back garden outfitted with chandeliers, a high glass roof, and tables crafted from vintage wine crates. The menu's foundation is Provençal cooking, but its lighthearted spirit feels free to stray. Begin with Amish bacon ""crack""-chili-spiked bacon jerky made from Pennsylvania Amish pigs. The duck breast is expertly seared, with crisp skin and a pink center. Don't skip the springy crêpes, filled with Nutella and ripe bananas.",French,"8 Little W. 12th St., New York 10014",37.0,NY,3.4,97,3,44,0,0,37.0,10014
BONDST,0.0,"There's no denying that BONDST is still trendy after all these years; it even manages to stay sexy with sheer fabric panels, wispy tree branches, dark leathers, and private spaces. The three-story interior fills nightly with a very European crowd. (Romantics head downstairs; Bacchanalians go up.) High quality fusion dishes may seem more crowd-pleasing than inventive, but are nonetheless delicious. Behind the wood sushi bar, the buzzing kitchen rolls mountains of maki, like paper-thin slices of pristine scallops balanced with a thick soy-jalapeño sauce and yuzu kosho. The soba nomi ""risotto"" is a wickedly rich and unmissable dish of glistening buckwheat soba folded with trout butter, king crab, and shrimp beneath a thatch of bonito flakes and gold paper.",Japanese,"6 Bond St., New York 10014",62.0,NY,4.2,131,3,55,0,0,62.0,10014
Gotham Bar and Grill,1.0,"Warm, personable, and genuine, Gotham Bar and Grill has everything a New York restaurant needs to stand the test of time. Inside, find towering floral arrangements and lofty ceilings hung with massive fabric-draped fixtures, which soften the room's appearance. The interior is vast, but the sunken dining area, elevated bar, and smartly divided room feel more classic than overdone. The service team exemplifies on-the-ball excellence. This kitchen's distinctive American seasonal cooking is in clear balance from start to finish. Begin with the simple-sounding tuna tartare combining chopped yellowfin and shiso surrounded by Japanese cucumber, enlivened with miso-ginger vinaigrette. Move on to explore seasonal risotto, showcasing wintery mushrooms or perhaps a summery feast of sweet shrimp, chives, and touch of tomato. Batter-fried soft-shell crabs are a feat of technical perfection, with body and crisped legs set over sautéed vegetables and a light citrus-soy reduction. Desserts alone are worth a visit, especially to indulge in the famously dense chocolate cake, served warm with a scoop of luscious salted-almond ice cream and cracked cocoa nibs. The ""greenmarket"" prix-fixe lunch offers great value and quality.",American,"12 E. 12th St., New York 10003",62.0,NY,4.5,377,4,2,1,1,112.5,10003
Le Gigot,0.0,"As classically beautiful and intricate as the Metro signs of Paris, this petitresto is dedicated to honoring The City of Light. Modeled after the Left Bank bistro Polidor, the iconic interior features parquet floors, zinc-topped tables, and antique mirrored walls. The room fills quickly with regulars; the dedicated staff graciously greets most by name. The food is equally beloved, with such classics as generous charcuterie platters that include sausage, duck rillettes, silky smooth chicken liver, and hearty country pâtés. The excellent boeuf Bourguignon is a comforting dish of braised beef cubes, carrots, potatoes, button mushrooms, sweet shallots, and plenty of bacon. Come dessert, tarte Tatin smells of apples and heaven (but with extra butter).",French,"18 Cornelia St., New York 10014",37.0,NY,4.4,43,2,44,0,0,37.0,10014
Lupa,0.0,"One of the best places for a solid plate of pasta, Lupa fits in snugly between the fire escape-clad walk-ups and charming boutiques along these streets. A modestly decorated spot named for the she-wolf who raised Romulus and Remus, this gem carries an air of relaxed sophistication. It's where neighbors can gather for polite conversation over quartinos of Ligurian wine or the massive collection of amari. If it's a lovely place to sit, it's a stellar place to dine. Textbook-perfect pasta shines here, with luscious bucatini all' amatriciana earning its mark among Lazio classics as well as the beguilingly simple yet stunning cacio e pepe. Entrées may sometimes miss the mark, but dessert more than makes up for it-try the unique cardamom panna cotta.",Italian,"170 Thompson St., New York 10012",37.0,NY,4.2,261,3,54,0,0,37.0,10012
Pearl Oyster Bar,0.0,"It's not hard to find a lobster roll in this city, and for that we can thank Rebecca Charles. This seafood institution-inspired by Charles' childhood summers spent in Maine-has been stuffing sweet lobster meat into split-top rolls since 1997. The two-room setting offers a choice: counter seating or table service. Wood furnishings and white walls are low-key; beachy memorabilia perks up the space. Start the meal by slurping your way through a classic chilled shellfish platter before tucking into that signature lobster roll, served alongside a tower of shoestring fries. The kitchen shines in daily specials, too, such as the grilled lobster served with corn pudding or pan-roasted wild bass. A hot fudge sundae is an appropriately nostalgic finish.",Seafood,"18 Cornelia St., New York 10014",37.0,NY,4.3,136,3,91,0,0,37.0,10014
Phoenix Garden,0.0,"This fuss-free and no-frills basement joint shows Chinatown that delicious Chinese food for a great value can exist outside of its borders. Forgo ho-hum lunch deals and pop in at dinnertime for a delectable selection of Cantonese cooking. The vast menu can take some navigating, so chat up the servers for their expert advice in order to get the goods. Highlights include exquisite salt-and-pepper shrimp, shell-on, butterflied, flash-fried and tossed with sliced chilies and garlic; sautéed snow pea leaves in an egg-white sauce of sweet crabmeat, carrots, and snow peas; sizzling eggplant casserole studded with minced pork and ham; and crispy Peking duck sliced tableside, rolled up in pancakes, and layered with hoisin, cucumber, and scallions.",Chinese,"242 E. 40th St., New York 10016",37.0,NY,3.7,51,2,29,0,0,37.0,10016
Dim Sum Go Go,0.0,"This wildly popular dim sum joint is still packed to the gills most days, and for good reason: the Cantonese fare and dim sum served up at this bright, contemporary spot is as good as the food you'll find trekking out to those super-authentic places in far-flung Queens. Even better, they take reservations-and dim sum orders are taken by the staff as opposed to rolled around on the traditional cart, helping ensure the food stays super fresh.If the price seems a bit higher than its competitors, you'll find it's worth it for dishes like sweet shrimp, rolled in rice paper and laced with dark soy sauce; plump snow pea leaf dumplings spiked with vibrant ginger and garlic; rich, tender duck dumplings; or an irresistibly flaky baked roast pork pie.",Chinese,"5 East Broadway, New York 10038",37.0,NY,3.7,174,2,29,0,0,37.0,10038
Peking Duck House,0.0,"It's worth your while to wend through Chinatown's teeming sidewalks to delight in the eponymous house specialty here. Once inside, however crowded, the neutral-toned interior adds a calming effect to the many tables gearing up for their bird's arrival, and the mode of transport is a linen-draped cart.The duck is deftly carved and dramatically served by the chef himself, so push in your chair and prepare for a festive DIY feast of warm, soft pancakes, cool cucumbers, scallions, and sweet hoisin. Although the duck is what makes this a destination, there are several other entrées like sizzling sliced beef with scallops; and live lobster with ginger and scallions. To begin, the clear golden broth of the duck wonton soup is an appropriate prelude to the main event.",Chinese,"28 Mott St., New York 10013",37.0,NY,3.8,210,2,29,0,0,37.0,10013
Babbo,1.0,"Is Mario Batali's beloved wild child of the fine dining scene mellowing a bit with age? Only in the best possible way. This warm, inviting mainstay still likes to keep its elegant good looks edgy with a little thumping music, but the general vibe inside seems to have settled into a sweeter, calmer version of its rambunctious youth. Nestled into quaint Waverly Place, Babbo's bi-level dining room fits right in: think shuttered windows and wrought-iron railings alongside thick wooden armchairs, white tablecloths, and the kind of dreamy low lighting made for late night rendezvous. The food itself is always artful and precise, and the menu more than delivers on its promise: creative, rustic Italian fare made with stellar skill and extraordinary ingredients. Mainstays like a delicate lamb's tongue vinaigrette arrives humming with tender beech mushrooms and topped with a 3-minute egg and mâche; while soft beef cheek ravioli bathed in a Castelmagno cheese- and black truffle-reduction is subtle but wow-inducing. Don't skip dessert: when this hot spot takes a swing on a classic semifreddo, drenching it in dark chocolate and a dusting of crushed pistachio, it hits it out of the park.",Italian,"110 Waverly Pl., New York 10011",112.5,NY,4.2,487,4,54,1,1,112.5,10011
Crispo,0.0,"Convivial Crispo is a breath of fresh, rustic air. A protruding façade shelters its terrazza, while the back garden decked in smooth river stones feels warmer. The inside is dark and low-slung with brick walls, mosaic floors, and wrought-iron seats set around tiny, round tables. A plating station and kitchen reside in the back, as the full bar hums up front. Courteous waiters attend to neatly arranged tables groaning beneath refined yet peasant-hearty food. Angel hair pasta is twirled around fresh seafood and then tossed in a fresh cherry tomato-cream sauce. Three tender lamb chops scottaditto (glistening with an herb-olive oil marinade) and served beside a goat cheese-polenta cake, could be sealed with a kiss of passion fruit or coconut sorbet.",Italian,"240 W. 14th St., New York 10011",37.0,NY,4.0,141,3,54,0,0,37.0,10011
Mary's Fish Camp,0.0,"This West Village seafood shack is much more than just a destination for lobster rolls. Located on an irresistibly cute corner with large windows, Mary's Fish Camp tempts with creative daily specials scrawled on a chalkboard, sweet and briny raw offerings, and nostalgic desserts like hot fudge sundaes. Crowds pack into the curving stainless steel counter while white, lazy fans spin overhead. The summery space offers lots of choice, but the lobster roll should not be overlooked. A toasted bun is overflowing with hunks of tender, sweet meat dressed in the perfect proportion of mayonnaise and lemon juice, with a mountain of shoestring fries on the side. Begin the meal with spicy Key West conch chowder and then end with a slice of Americana-banana cream pie.",Seafood,"64 Charles St., New York 10014",37.0,NY,4.1,107,2,91,0,0,37.0,10014
Nebraska Steakhouse,0.0,"Marked by a relatively modest and discreet façade, Nebraska Steakhouse remains a well-tread fixture in the FiDi. This classic watering hole with equally brazen diners hovering around a tiny, narrow, and well-soaked bar evokes that old-timey city tavern scene. Inside, the vibe is lively, drinks are strong, and their appetizing offerings are expertly handled. Finding the door isn't a cakewalk and manipulating the crowd takes some negotiating, but rest assured that the end result is worth it. Yes, those steaks are on-point, but smoked trout salad followed by 22-ounces of tender and juicy grilled lamb Porterhouse chops never fails to sate. In contrast with the gruff service, a pecan pie studded with chocolate chips and heavy cream is so sweet.",Steakhouse,"15 Stone St., New York 10004",62.0,NY,4.0,15,3,99,0,0,62.0,10004
Il Riccio,0.0,"Long-standing and low-key, this is just the right spot to recharge after an afternoon of perusing fabulous neighborhood boutiques or meandering through the nearby museums. Il Riccio has a cozy feel with warm ochre walls, simple furnishings, and an assemblage of photographs. Regulars know to head back to the enclosed garden to enjoy their meal. The cooking here is fuss-free, pasta-focused, and lovingly dedicated to the Amalfi Coast. Favored dishes include roasted red peppers topped with salty, marinated white anchovies; or fedelini primavera, a rustic presentation of thin pasta strands tossed with an assortment of fresh vegetables and well-seasoned tomato sauce. Grilled fish dressed simply with olive oil and lemon rounds out the menu.",Italian,"152 E. 79th St., New York 10021",37.0,NY,4.3,15,3,54,0,0,37.0,10021
JoJo,0.0,"Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten's little neighborhood bistro has been serving these affluent residents for nearly a generation, offering proof that although trends may come and go, classics remain steadfast. Within Jojo's snug townhouse quarters, ritzy locals and well-heeled tourists dine at elegantly dressed tables-think starched linens and polished silver-amid terra-cotta tile floors, plum velvet banquettes, and toile drapery. The look isn't fresh or exciting, but the cuisine makes up for it. Lunch offers great value for three courses that have featured a salad of warm asparagus with avocado; pan-roasted hake and sautéed wild mushrooms dressed with lime segments and a ginger-scallion condiment; and a zucchini cake with pecan ice cream for dessert.",Contemporary,"160 E. 64th St., New York 10021",62.0,NY,4.2,106,3,44,0,0,37.0,10021
Lusardi's,0.0,"With its pumpkin-colored walls, dark woodwork, and vintage posters, this beloved old-school mainstay offers a menu that relishes in decadant Northern Italian cooking. Picture an array of fresh pasta and veal, richly embellished with cream, authentic cheeses, or truffle-infused olive oil. The insalata bianca is a monotone-white yet delightfully refreshing composition of shaved fennel, sliced artichoke hearts, chopped endive, and slivered hearts of palm dressed with lemony vinaigrette and Parmigiano Reggiano, all singing with black pepper freshly ground tableside. Paccheri in salsa affumicata presents large pasta tubes draped with plum tomato sauce that has been enriched with creamy smoked mozzarella and strewn with bits of roasted eggplant.",Italian,"1494 Second Ave., New York 10021",62.0,NY,4.5,35,3,54,0,0,37.0,10021
Orsay,0.0,"With its mahogany paneling, hand-laid mosaic tiles, windows dressed with lacy café curtains, and pewter bar, this luxe brasserie is a painstakingly realized vision of art nouveau. Orsay proves its dedication to French tradition from the sidewalk seating to marble stairs leading up to a private room. Chef Antoine Camin's cheese soufflés sustain much of the well-dressed crowd here, but the classic menu brings much more. Soupe de poisson is a richly satisfying fusion of fish, tomatoes, fennel, and herbs; brook trout is presented à la Grenobloise with browned butter, capers, and finely diced croutons; and roasted pork tenderloin arrives with savoy cabbage, apples, and hard cider sauce. The soaked baba au rhum is as fine a rendition as any à Paris.",French,"1057 Lexington Ave., New York 10021",37.0,NY,3.8,75,3,44,0,0,37.0,10021
Shanghai Pavilion,0.0,"Polished Shanghai Pavilion offers plenty of choice, but the slurp-inducing steamed juicy buns are what keeps the crowds returning time and again. Pay attention to the list of chef's picks, which should include firm chunks of grey sole braised in sweet rice wine sauce. This Shanghainese specialty is studded with crisp pea pods and plump goji berries for a memorable combination of subtle elements. Clean, simple flavors underscore every bit of the soft bean curd sheets tossed with fresh soybeans and pickled cabbage. Unique tastes are a highlight in ""Hang Zhou"" beef presented in a bamboo steamer lined with cabbage, topped with strips of tender beef and slivered green onions, dressed in soy sauce and spicy oil. Service is as upscale as the attractive room.",Chinese,"1378 Third Ave., New York 10021",37.0,NY,3.8,21,2,29,0,0,37.0,10021
Aureole,1.0,"Nestled smack dab in the middle of the melee that constitutes modern-day Times Square, Aureole's message is clear from the moment you enter its serene glass façade: drop your bags (and perhaps your shoulders) and relax-it's time to be pampered by a truly exquisite seafood-centric meal in a luxurious setting. Up front, you'll find the Liberty Room, home to a lively bar that's ideal for an after-work drink or pre-dinner cocktail; and a small collection of handsome, walnut-topped tables comprising a more casual dining area. Toward the back of the restaurant, the formal dining room cuts an impressive, elegant figure with sexy low lighting; crisp white tablecloths; and polished table settings. Dinner might begin with a beautifully composed peekytoe crab salad, sporting vibrant green avocado panna cotta, juicy watermelon and sea beans; and then move on to a gorgeous slice of fresh Alaskan black cod in a sweet and savory marinade, paired with crisp snap peas, bok choy, and choy sum. End with a stunning finale like the elegantly prepared Saint Honoré, a flaky tuille topped with a flower-shaped pinwheel piped with silky Manjari chocolate mousse and dotted with light-as-air choux puffs.",Contemporary,"135 W. 42nd St., New York 10036",112.5,NY,4.4,206,4,2,1,1,112.5,10036
Café Boulud,1.0,"Taking its cue from classic French cuisine, Daniel Boulud's refined vision of food and beverage at the Surrey hotel is comprised of two spaces: the jewel box known as Bar Pleiades and this elegant, appealingly understated restaurant. Inside, ritzy residents and in-the-know globetrotters dine in a well-groomed, secluded room furnished with plush carpeting, rich wood accents, and mirrored surfaces. Sparkling elements atop beautifully laid tables set off the spot's conviviality, and gallant, smartly-dressed servers display unwavering competence in their presentation of uniquely constructed and superb tasting compositions. Under the watch of Chef Aaron Bludorn, the kitchen makes culinary decisions that never disappoint. Classically done poulet rôti showcases evenly moist, crispy skinned chicken finished with a fragrant tarragon jus, while the Crescent Farms Pekin duck, cooked to a perfect pink and sprinkled with coarse salt, is served with currant-studded kasha for wonderful depth in flavor and texture. For dessert, intricately layered crêpe cakes are garnished with rhubarb gelée and kissed with ricotta sorbet.

Blue Water Grill,0.0,"This New York institution has become an iconic part of the Union Square landscape. The stately building is a former bank, with century-old architectural details and marble aplenty. As the name would suggest, the menu leans heavily on seafaring classics with an ample raw bar and sushi counter. But more than anything, this kitchen aims to please, with starters like pork belly sliders topped with tangy fennel-lettuce slaw on a brioche bun. Octopus tentacles are crisp yet perfectly tender inside, served resting atop chickpeas with a deep-red tomato and roasted pepper ragout infused with smoked paprika. Fish is always perfectly handled and often rises well above its accompaniments on the plate. Live jazz is a nightly draw to the downstairs lounge.",Seafood,"31 Union Sq.

Casa Mono,1.0,"Casa Mono is tiny, jammed, and totally New York. Furnished with a few closely packed tables that moan under the excess of mouthwatering plates as well as that mighty counter framed by a handful of seats, this grotto-like wine bar is loud, communal-and an absolute thrill. Then consider the service, which moves like clockwork and confirms that this is no slipshod show. The staff may be brisk in their presentation of the kitchen's ambitious renditions of tapas, but with flavors so delicious and concepts inventive, so be it. A faithful mix of locals and hungry out-of-towners convene for fantastic bite-sized eats like buttery bone marrow with smoked caper chermoulah-a house signature that is rich, flavorful, and entirely unmissable. Even the humble bacalao fritter attains new heights here as a deep-fried, fluffy delight coupled with sweet-citrusy alioli. Lastly, fallback plates like razor clams a la plancha in garlic-parsley sauce remain outstanding, consistent, and full of Spanish soul. This kitchen isn't frightened to explore, so skill and innovation are at the forefront of every morsel, including the thick, creamy, and luscious crema catalana con buñuelos. One word comes to mind: bliss. Oenophiles may head next door to drinking-focused sidekick, Bar Jamón.",Spanish,"52 Irving Pl., New York 10003",62.0,NY,4.2,192,3,98,1,1,37.0,10003
Craftbar,0.0,"Its ersatz industrial aesthetic and the rumble of the subway below combine to create a sense of energy and toil-although the service team can sometimes fail to embrace these concepts with any great vigor. But never mind because, as the name suggests, there's a big bar here, and a menu that has something for everyone. There is quite a pronounced Asian flavor in many of the dishes, such as the big bowl of PEI mussels with Kaffir lime, chili paste, and Sichuan pepper. Those, however, who prefer their culinary influences a little more homegrown, will find much comfort in the ""double stack"" burger. Anyone mindful of the heart-its health, not its emotional state-will be reassured by the presence of ingredients like kale on the menu.",Contemporary,"900 Broadway, New York 10003",37.0,NY,3.9,161,3,11,0,0,37.0,10003
Craft,0.0,"It's been many years since super-celebrity chef and TV personality Tom Colicchio opened Craft to great acclaim. Its popularity hasn't waned and the room is filled nightly with casually affluent New Yorkers. Good looks and a committed service team are the top assets and the décor is timeless yet cozy, aerial yet intimate. Bare bulbs emit a glow over wood tables and that smug, handsome bar should be drawing more diners. The menu's forte lies in its meandering conceit, allowing guests to ""craft"" their own meal. Prices are aggressive and these pristine ingredients often plead for a bit more salt or a bit less cooking, but pastas and desserts are where this kitchen shines. A fall tagliatelle with a bath of white truffles is a stunning example of what's possible.",American,"43 E. 19th St., New York 10003",112.5,NY,4.4,183,3,32,0,0,87.25,10003
Eleven Madison Park,3.0,"Chef Daniel Humm's cooking is clever, innovative and at times even a little whimsical; it is robust when it needs to be but also delicate at times and it is this variety and depth that really sets it apart. No menu is presented; instead, you're merely asked to relay your list of allergies as though talking to your pharmacist and your work is done. The 15 or so courses that subsequently appear could be playful, like the carrot tartare made at the table, or display extraordinary understanding of technique, such as the dry-aged veal with bone marrow. The restaurant is housed within the sort of grandeur that could only ever have belonged to a financial institution. It's a hard space to fill-conversations don't so much hang in the air as float up to the vast ceiling and never return. But somehow the room's sheer scale and the well-spaced tables allow you to feel cocooned in your own world. Considerable help comes courtesy of the engaging staff as they explain each dish in loving terms but without ever sounding too virtuous. They also know when to talk and when to leave you to get on with enjoying yourself.",Contemporary,"11 Madison Ave., New York 10010",112.5,NY,4.6,579,4,32,1,2,112.5,10010
Tocqueville,0.0,"Be it lunch or dinner, few New York restaurants convey the civility found at Tocqueville, courtesy of Chef Marco Moreira and his wife Joann Makovitzky. The serene, butterscotch-colored room features spaciously arranged tables draped with starched linen and laden with sparkling cutlery and stemware. Tocqueville's location, just steps away from the Union Square Greenmarket, influences its seasonally driven menu. A salad of frisée, shaved celery, and roasted local pear arranged with slices of nutty Cato Farm cheddar is a delightful starting point. House-made silken tofu presented with ginger-infused mushroom broth demonstrates the kitchen's global inspiration.

Turkish Kitchen,0.0,"Turkish Kitchen showcases all the classics but excels in the preparation of grilled meats. Indulge in yogurtlu karisik, a dish of moist and smoky char-grilled lamb, chicken, and spicy kebabs on a cooling bed of garlic-scented yogurt sauce and pita bread. Pillowy beef dumplings also wade in a pool of that signature garlicky yogurt sauce topped with paprika-infused oil and a dusting of sumac, oregano, and mint. A wide selection of Turkish wines makes a fine accompaniment to a hearty meal. Dangling globe light fixtures give the entrance to this cavernous, multi-level restaurant with floor-to-ceiling windows a modern glow. Tables are topped with pristine white cloths and set between black and white striped chairs; cherry-red walls lend a pop of color.",Turkish,"386 Third Ave., New York 10016",37.0,NY,4.1,131,2,102,0,0,37.0,10016
Malagueta,0.0,"A longstanding spot for authentic Northeastern Brazilian fare, Malagueta's pop of color and spice stands out from its residential surroundings. From its personable and dedicated staff to the warm and unassuming setting, this culturally rich retreat keeps locals and destination diners returning to the tiny spot and settling into a bistro chair. The kitchen plays with smoky, sour, hot, and salty flavors stewed to mellowness to strike just the right balance. Even the humble arroz y feijao is a deeply satisfying blend of tender beans with pearly white rice. Picanha features grilled slices of sirloin topped with farofa (toasted manioc flour), enhanced by a citrus-herb vinaigrette, and accompanied by rice and beans. Finish with an excellent coconut flan.",Brazilian,"25-35 36th Ave., Astoria 11106",37.0,NY,4.4,46,2,16,0,0,37.0,11106
Trattoria L'incontro,0.0,"A litany of delights sets the stage for an entertaining evening at this beloved institution of Italian-American pleasure. Frescoes of tranquil Italian scenes adorn coral walls in the unfussy dining room, complete with white-clothed tables spread at an ample distance. Service is relaxed, professional, and even theatrical in their performance of reciting special upon special. Flavors are classic and robust, from eggplant rollatini stuffed with ricotta and herbs to the ravioli golosi, filled with both ground filet and veal, then topped with a sauce of mushrooms and sausage. Tender veal scaloppini is gently dredged and pan-fried, then bathed in a silky sauce of wine, butter, garlic, and lemon. Crunching through crisp cannoli is a divine finale.",Italian,"21-76 31st St., Astoria 11105",37.0,NY,4.4,137,3,54,0,0,37.0,11105
Tribeca Grill,0.0,"Beckoning business titans day and night, this corner restaurant is a destination for its big, bright dining room with well-spaced tables. Wall-to-wall windows overlook two quintessential TriBeCa streets, while exposed brick, moody artwork, and a spectacular bar smack in the center of the room complete the refined vibe. Gigantone, large tubular pasta loaded with a braised short rib Bolognese beneath a dollop of fresh sheep's milk ricotta, makes a rich start to a meal. The decadence continues with seared scallops over creamy carrot risotto, topped with a truffled-Madeira vinaigrette, and brought over the top with a few fragrant shavings of black truffle. Desserts are as classic as the space; try the banana tart with malted chocolate and pecan ice cream.",Contemporary,"375 Greenwich St., New York 10013",62.0,NY,4.0,293,4,11,0,0,62.0,10013
Aquavit,2.0,"Gorgeously Scandinavian yet pleasantly corporate, Aquavit is a tribute to the Nordic culinary movement with more midtown-friendly appeal. The décor flaunts a bit of playfulness thanks to a mossy green carpet, fur-covered bag stools, and retro lighting. The ambience is quiet and waiters a tad imperious. Evening tasting menus and a wonderful three-course prix-fixe with overlapping options mean that an array of appetites and budgets can be readily accommodated. The dinner hour is when the chef's true style shines most brightly, through clean and unfussy cooking that is a lovely blend of European techniques and Scandinavian flavors. Klädesholmen Matjes herring is reinvented for the modern palate, encrusted in seeds and rye cubes served on a piece of slate, alongside soft-boiled quail eggs, Västerbotten cheese, and a swipe of horseradish. Follow this with a springtime composition of crisp-skinned Arctic char over pea purée, nettles, sweet and snap peas, and a few halved shrimp. Desserts that feature a textural composition of chocolates are a contemporary highlight. Lunch is a low-key, business-like gathering of Swedish meatballs and skagen, but the service is thankfully far less uptight.",Scandinavian,"65 E. 55th St., New York 10022",112.5,NY,4.4,181,4,90,1,2,112.5,10022
BLT Steak,0.0,"The best steakhouse in New York City is hotly contested among many contenders, but this handsome retreat sets itself apart with genuine hospitality, great management, and Sunday nights filled with hungry families and friends. This spot nails crowd-pleasing dishes like addictively hot popovers the size of softballs served to every table, which are extra delicious when slathered with butter and sea salt. Steaks are good, but sides truly excel, from inch-thick and perfectly crunchy onion rings to umami-rich and salty roasted mushrooms. Even crispy potato skins get the special treatment here-first baked, then deep-fried, and finally topped with bacon, cheese, sour cream, and chives. It may be a precursor to a heart attack, but it's worth every bite.",Steakhouse,"106 E. 57th St., New York 10022",112.5,NY,4.4,118,4,99,0,0,112.5,10022
Lavagna,0.0,"The little menu at this neighborhood fixture proves that quality trumps size. Lavagna's kitchen is snug but still manages to make ample use of a wood-burning oven to bake everything from delicate pizette to whole roasted fish. Pastas are always a treat, while other tasty options can include pan-fried smoked scamorza paired with a roasted red pepper crostini, juicy rack of lamb, or a slice of spot-on crostata filled with seasonal fruit and dressed with caramel sauce. Framed mirrors, a pressed-tin ceiling, and candlelight produce a mood that is almost as warm as the genuinely gracious service, which ensures that regulars receive the royal treatment. That said, everyone who steps through these doors feels welcome and well taken care of.",Italian,"545 E. 5th St., New York 10009",37.0,NY,4.4,70,2,54,0,0,37.0,10009
Momofuku Noodle Bar,0.0,"This elder member of David Chang's culinary empire is hipper and hotter than ever. A honey-toned temple of updated comfort food, decked with blonde wood counters and a sparkling open kitchen, the service here may be brisk. But rest assured, as the menu is gutsy and molded with Asian street food in mind. Those steamed buns have amassed a gargantuan following thanks to decadent fillings like moist pork loin kissed with Hollandaise and chives. Additionally, that bowl of springy noodles doused in a spicy ginger-scallion sauce is just one instance of the crew's signature work. Korean fried chicken with seasonal greens is fit for a king; while more modest items, including desserts like candy apple truffle, are beautifully crafted and rightfully elevated to global fame.",Asian,"171 First Ave., New York 10003",37.0,NY,4.1,779,2,4,0,0,37.0,10003
Felidia,0.0,"Cookbook author, television series host, and restaurateur Lidia Bastianich has been behind this flagship restaurant and greeting customers since 1981. Service could use a little finesse and some of Bastianich's charm, but the elegant décor inspires dressing up for dinner and the exceptional wine list offers a vast collection of Italian choices. Signature paste sparkle here, such as cacio e pere ravioli stuffed with delicate pear and bathed in black pepper and pecorino. Massive portions of scallops, squid, a split langoustine, and lobster star in the grigliata drizzled with lemon vinaigrette. Rely on Lidia to deliver a cannoli that lives up to its true potential-envision narrow tubes filled with lemony ricotta cream spilling into the center of the plate.",Italian,"243 E. 58th St., New York 10022",112.5,NY,4.1,120,4,54,0,0,112.5,10022
Jubilee,0.0,"Settled into sleek Sutton Place, Jubilee is New York City's very own version of Cheers. Affluent families are in full force here, while friends gather on weeknights to mingle over wine and fine French-Belgian cuisine. The European-inflected nautical décor screams quaint coastal elegance with perpetually packed tables and a bar where everybody knows your name. A silky, saffron-scented fish soup, accompanied by grated Gruyère, a few croûtes, and pot of rouille is deliciously classic and incredibly sumptuous. But before filling up, be sure to sample the sole meuniere-a delicate fish seared perfectly and served with sautéed spinach leaves. If that doesn't sound like the best way to end a long day, their popular crème brûlée offers the ultimate fix.",French,"948 First Ave., New York 10022",37.0,NY,4.0,28,3,44,0,0,37.0,10022
La Grenouille,0.0,"La Grenouille is a bastion of old-world glamor and manners with an exorbitant budget for floral arrangements. Although this storied enclave still attracts a devoted following, there's always room for local newbies and blinged-out tourists. Everyone looks good in this lavish space, where red velvet banquettes, polished wood veneer, and softly lit tables bathe the room in rose and apricot hues. Classic and classy, this French cuisine deserves high praise. Delicate ravioli is stuffed with chopped lobster hinting of tarragon and dressed with creamy, tart beurre blanc; an exquisitely tender-seared beef filet arrives with pommes Darphin and a lick of perfect sauce au poivre; and for dessert, the île flottante is heaven under a cloud of spun caramel.",French,"3 E. 52nd St., New York 10022",112.5,NY,4.5,128,4,44,0,0,112.5,10022
Sushi Yasuda,1.0,"Efficiency trumps hospitality at this sushi temple, where warm honey-toned bamboo slats are by far the warmest feature. Reservations are managed with little coddling, arrivals lack any greeting, tardiness is not accepted, and loitering at the counter is not an option. But to sushi-loving diehards, this is just the cost of admission. Tables packed with suits (this is midtown, after all) should be avoided in favor of the sleek counter attended to by a pristinely attired staff as this is where the magic happens. And, your experience here depends entirely on the itamae enlisted in front of you. Their mission is to ensure that each diner receives fish that has just been cut, formed, and dressed moments before it is eaten. After years of buildup, this kitchen is finally living up to its hype-with a wealth of classically assembled and spectacularly fresh sushi on offer. Every item is handled with such care and is truly memorable: a sparkling combo of sea scallop and oyster is sprinkled with soy sauce, sea salt, and lemon; a duo of uni lets the palate compare specimens from Santa Barbara and Hokkaido; and a trio of King, Alaskan white, and wild New Zealand salmon nigiri makes for a fantastic treat.",Japanese,"204 E. 43rd St., New York 10017",112.5,NY,4.3,335,4,55,1,1,112.5,10017
Aquagrill,0.0,"New York is no stranger to oysters but Aquagrill is an institution that puts the other shuckers to shame. A destination for all-things seafood since the 1990s, the menu features as many as 27 types of oysters each day, with patrons holing up at the bar to ingest dozens upon dozens of these bivalves with pitch-perfect wines to match. As always, the kitchen serves a fine lineup of heartier fish dishes including the downright sensual wild toro tartare with shiitakes, peppercress, and truffle-soy sauce. Pan-seared red snapper over crispy jasmine rice cakes and sautéed vegetables in ginger-peanut sauce is a show of well-balanced textures and bracing flavors; but a handmade chocolate sampler remains the true starlet, with each morsel as decadent as the next.",Seafood,"210 Spring St., New York 10012",37.0,NY,4.3,245,3,91,0,0,37.0,10012
Balthazar,0.0,"As ageless as its beautiful patrons, the brassy and mirrored Balthazar should be called ""quintessentially SoHo"" because it invented the term. One of the benchmark brasseries from serial restaurateur Keith McNally, the attractive space is housed in a former tannery. Those whiffs of leather have been replaced by red awnings, scents of pastries, and an excellent oyster-filled raw bar completing its Parisian transformation. It seems as though every other table is topped with their bestselling steak frites-hardly a value but expertly prepared and served with a heaping side of fries. On the delicate side, sautéed skate is served with sweet raisins and tart capers; while silky beef tartare with shallots, herbs, and Worcestershire spreads just like butta.",French,"80 Spring St., New York 10012",62.0,NY,4.2,898,3,44,0,0,37.0,10012
Giorgione,0.0,"In far west SoHo, beyond Chanel and Balenciaga, find this long-time resident cherished for its quiet location where Spring Street locals enjoy a slower pace-much like Italy itself. Founded by Dean & Deluca's Giorgio Deluca, the stylish and distinctly Italian L-shaped room focuses on straightforward pizza, outstanding pastas, and serious desserts. You can't go wrong with the handful of pastas on the menu, such as the lovingly crafted pouches of spinach and ricotta ravioli in a light tomato sauce. Delicately grilled lamb chops with peperonata and rosemary-roasted new potatoes are simple yet beguiling. Try one (or two) noteworthy desserts, including the flaky crostata filled with rich chocolate ganache and bright green pistacchio di Bronte.",Italian,"307 Spring St., New York 10012",37.0,NY,4.4,36,2,54,0,0,37.0,10012
Le Bernardin,3.0,"Eric Ripert's paean to all things piscatorial is unquestionably one of the daddies of the New York dining scene. No one gets to occupy this amount of prime midtown real estate for this long without knowing exactly what they're doing-and doing it supremely well. Run with consummate ease by a well-organized team, its influence stretches beyond merely the entertaining of big-hitters and even bigger spenders. But however celebrated, the sine qua non of any self-respecting seafood restaurant must be the ability to cook a piece of fish absolutely perfectly and, in this, Le Bernardin displays deftness and consistency. Just try the luxuriantly buttery wild striped bass and you'll get the idea. ""Almost Raw,"" ""Barely Touched,"" and ""Lightly Cooked"" are the headings under which you'll find an impressive array of dishes. The influences are global but the cooking is underpinned by a mastery of technique; ingredients are of unimpeachable quality and the kitchen has the confidence to never overcrowd a plate so that the fish always remains the star of the show.",Seafood,"155 W. 51st St., New York 10019",112.5,NY,4.6,671,4,91,1,2,112.5,10019
Per Se,3.0,"There is no more dramatic departure from the soulless Time Warner Center than entering through the iconic blue doors to Per Se. An upscale sense of calm-the kind that only money can buy-instantly soaks the atmosphere. The words posh and exclusive come to mind when admiring the spacious tables, corner banquettes, and stunning views. Chef Thomas Keller continues to raise the bar with meals that express artistry and seasonality right down to the moment. A classic since day one, the ""oysters and pearls"" still swim in that bath of luxurious caviar. Summery flavors reach their peak in the beautiful roulade of veal breast en persillade. The extraordinary vegetable tasting menu will threaten to convert the most die-hard omnivore with chestnut- and mascarpone-filled agnolotti dressed with julienned Tuscan kale and pickled Swiss chard stems. Flavors and textures may temporarily veer off into strange (and slow) territory during cheese and dessert courses. While this innovative and creative vision may delight some, it will confound others. No matter. The celebrated ""coffee and doughnuts"" is a grand finale. Those without reservations can stop at the opulent Salon, where much of the menu is available à la carte.",Contemporary,"10 Columbus Circle, New York 10019",112.5,NY,4.6,506,4,2,1,2,112.5,10019
Spotted Pig,1.0,"It's impossible to tell if the famously talented April Bloomfield ever imagined the celebrity draw her restaurant would have over the likes of, say, Kanye West (who reputedly tweeted a drinks invite here to his followers). But many years ago, when Spotted Pig sashayed its way onto an adorable corner of the West Village, New York City was more than ready to meet-and fall completely in love with-the gastropub. But as popular as the restaurant (and now the gastropub trend itself) has grown, Bloomfield's cooking has always been the real draw. And, it doesn't matter if you are teetering on a wooden stool, knocking elbows with pencil-thin hipsters all night in this cozy, bi-level space. With food like this, you might as well be on the moon. Bloomfield has made her name on those outstanding burgers, pan-seared mackerel, and legendary gnudi (feather-light orbs of ricotta ""gnocchi"" laced with brown butter, crispy sage, and nutty parmesan) but you really can't miss on this menu. Kick things off with a small plate of fresh, creamy burrata and grilled sourdough, spread with fava, mint, and a few chili flakes; and then move on to a perfectly roasted poussin, served with Sherry vinegar, grilled ramps, and delicate spring onions.",Gastropub,"314 W. 11th St., New York 10014",62.0,NY,4.1,922,3,18,1,1,62.0,10014
Wallsé,1.0,"There are some foods that just feel right at certain times of the year. When the nights draw in and there's a little chill in the air, there are certain words whose very presence on a menu summon feelings of comfort and warmth-and those words surely include spaetzle, schnitzel, and strudel. Austrian cuisine is known for being hearty and immeasurably satisfying, but the great strength of Wallsé is that you don't have to have spent the day skiing in Innsbruck to appreciate its cuisine because the adept kitchen has a lightness of touch and is not rigidly tied to tradition. Whether you've chosen the loin of venison with bone marrow or have gone for the tafelspitz, you'll find the dishes are nicely balanced and effortlessly easy to eat. The restaurant is divided into two rooms, both dominated by striking paintings, some of which are of the chef himself. The clientele is a largely sophisticated bunch with an inherent understanding of how restaurants work which, in turn, creates an easy, relaxing atmosphere. The wine list also merits examination, if only to discover there's more to Austrian wine than Grüner Veltliner.",Austrian,"344 W. 11th St., New York 10014",62.0,NY,4.4,69,3,7,1,1,49.5,10014
Blue Hill,1.0,"Chef Dan Barber's iconic venue remains the paragon of farm-to-table dining in Manhattan by virtue of its seasonal lineup of pampered product. Everything on the menu is sourced from the Stone Barns Center (home to Blue Hill's Westchester farm) as well as a number of local producers. Blue Hill's intimate space has been hosting a devoted foodie following for an impressive 15-some years, and service in this former speakeasy-where fresh flowers and candlelight cast a romantic spell-is nothing less than excellent. The adept kitchen turns out contemporary cuisine, which in turn showcases the astounding quality stocked in the larder and allows vegetables to shine at all times. Asparagus spears are gently roasted to preserve their natural earthiness and coupled with vibrant beet yogurt as well as stinging nettles cream for a perfect balance in flavor. Then, moist striped bass draped atop fennel purée is decked with soft, sweet currants and toasted salty pine nuts to form a succulent and satisfying entrée. Familiar desserts highlight still more of the kitchen's best, as is the case with light and custard-y brioche bread pudding coupled with a quenelle of pleasantly bitter cocoa nib cream.",American,"75 Washington Pl., New York 10011",37.0,NY,4.5,241,4,2,1,1,112.5,10011
Masa,3.0,"To taste what may be the continent's best sushi, experience the quiet, contemplative, and very exclusive ceremony of Chef Masa Takayama's omakase. Through the heavy wooden door, discover a room that is as unchanging and calming as a river stone, set amid blonde hinoki wood and a gargantuan forsythia tree. Yes, you'll forget it's on the fourth floor of a mall. Attention to detail is unsurpassed; that bespoke Japanese porcelain seems designed specifically for the sweet shrimp it holds. Service displays the same smooth grace, unobtrusive yet at-the-ready with their hot towels, fingerbowls, tea, and touches of pedagogy or insight. Don't let their tendency to upsell extra courses mar your pleasure. A seaweed salad of vinegar-seasoned jellyfish awakens the palate to the subtle progression of courses that follow. Masterful proportion and elemental balance is unparalleled in the mind-melting toro tartare with salty grains of Californian osetra caviar and toasted bread for crunch. Yet Masa truly distinguishes itself with its parade of sushi showcasing the best of Tokyo's Tsukiji market. Expect phenomenal aji mackerel with grated yuzu, traditional unagi, and an indelible finish of toro temaki.",Japanese,"10 Columbus Circle, New York 10019",112.5,NY,4.4,6,4,55,1,2,112.5,10019
Gramercy Tavern,1.0,"In a roll-call of New York's most beloved restaurants of the last couple of decades, Gramercy Tavern would be high on many people's list. It is one of those places that manage the rare trick of being so confident in its abilities that it can be all things to all people. You'll probably leave happy whether you've come on a date or are here to impress the in-laws; whether you're closing a deal or simply lubricating the thought processes behind a deal. The ""Tavern"" side is the better one for lunch, especially if there are only two of you and you can sit at the bar-it doesn't take bookings so get here early and join in the grown-up ""I'm not really queuing, I'm just standing here"" queue outside. The ""Dining Room"" is for those who like a little more pomp with their pappardelle, and really comes into its own in the evening. The cooking is the perfect match for the warm and woody surroundings: this is American food sure of its footing and unthreatening in its vocabulary. The main component, be it sea bass or pork loin, is allowed to shine and there is a refreshing lack of over-elaboration on the plate that demonstrates the confidence of the kitchen.",Contemporary,"42 E. 20th St., New York 10003",112.5,NY,4.5,711,4,2,1,1,112.5,10003
Jewel Bako,1.0,"Black walls surrounding two tiny windows form the façade of this surreptitious gem. Unlike the diverse neighborhood in which it resides, the décor inside the long room is simple and sleek, framed by low ceilings, curving bamboo slats, and close-knit tables. Servers are smartly attired if a little too-cool-for-school, but the passionate chefs here provide a wealth of culinary entertainment. This is a place where painstaking detail is evident from start to finish. A large square plate, for instance, may feature the likes of ruby-red tuna set beside soy-mirin sauce; an edible cup filled with a spicy salmon mixture; densely packed roe topped with bonito flakes; and a peppery watercress salad. Then, a thick cut of salmon marinated in three types of miso and cooked en papillote is unwrapped to reveal the most tender, moist, and flaky meat. And finally, each grain of slightly sticky rice in the sushi omakase is cooked perfectly and combined with fluke, Tasmanian trout, and creamy otoro. Young couples as well as die-hard downtowners idolize this ""jewel"" and for good reason-a dessert of green tea ice cream sandwiched between chocolate chip cookies is exemplary, delicious, and very, very special.",Japanese,"239 E. 5th St., New York 10003",62.0,NY,4.3,73,3,55,1,1,62.0,10003
Jean-Georges,3.0,"The crown-jewel restaurant of a crown-jewel Trump hotel, Jean-Georges reigns supreme over the Central Park dining scene. Facing its lush grounds and mighty Columbus himself, the restaurant's separate entrance can be something of a whirlwind as guests must pass through buzzing Nougatine to arrive at this silver-gray dining room. Still, those immense windows, columns, and twinkling skyline views make this a very special place. On weekdays, the feel is formal and business-driven, while weekends hum with affluent tourists, local socialites, and an easier vibe. The highly professional service staff is one well-oiled and smooth machine. While the contemporary menu is fixed, options are numerous and particularly appealing. Let the fascinating interplay of flavors begin with sea trout and oyster tartare merged with horseradish cream, lemon, and chive oil. Simple but lavish elegance underscores a perfectly cooked Maine lobster accompanied by roasted chili paste. Composed with Asian flavors and French technique, this is a standout worthy of a special occasion. And in place of a single, haunting finale, desserts are served as a ""sampler"" focused on one ingredient-say caramel-in all its outrageous glory.",Contemporary,"1 Central Park West, New York 10023",112.5,NY,4.4,485,4,44,1,2,112.5,10023
Public,1.0,"Let the other restaurants copy each other down to the table linens: Public has always done it's own thing, and boy, does it do it right. Housed in an old loading dock in SoHo, Public still sports elevated garage doors on its exterior, but the sexy interior is pure style and grace. The décor features unique bronze mailboxes, where box-holders are delivered artisanal wines hand-selected by the chef, and private rooms contoured with billowing fabrics. A first-come, first-serve ""Sunday Supper"" menu is offered every Sunday with limited seating, and almost always sells out. Chef Brad Farmerie's menu is truly innovative-fusion might be an overused descriptor, but it aptly describes his style. Never shy to marry unique items in interesting ways (think smoked paprika oil paired with pea shoots), a sample Farmerie dinner might include house-made ricotta cavatelli tossed in a lovely carrot sauce fashioned like a Bolognese, with pickled ramps, candied sunflower seeds, and a ramp purée; or tender New Zealand venison with pickled beets, hibiscus, currants, and a quinoa-black garlic salad. End on a high with pea-and-crème fraîche ice cream with green matcha, sponge cake, ganache, and lemon tapioca.",Fusion,"210 Elizabeth St., New York 10012",62.0,NY,4.0,239,4,52,1,1,87.25,10012
The Modern,2.0,"It goes without saying that The Modern has one of the city's most prized locations, designed to capture the iconic feel of MoMA in which it is seamlessly housed. Art enthusiasts appreciate these modernist surrounds, which are timeless and particularly glorious. The bar-cum-lounge up front is all buzz, while the dining room's view of the lush sculpture garden lends tranquility that is conducive to intimacy and quiet conversation. Chef Abram Bissell and team have settled in and are truly wowing these fine, globe-trotting patrons with excellent food complete with a palpably unique personality. Meanwhile, service remains well-timed and always warm. Appealing dishes showcase neat, clean flavors and may include roasted cauliflower florets composed with perfectly creamy crab butter, almond-cauliflower purée, and sweet, fleshy crabmeat. Delicate balance and top quality ingredients are at the height of an exceedingly tender lobster ""marinated with truffles"" and served in a luscious sauce with shaved radishes and bright herbs. And, for dessert, rhubarb bread pudding is topped with vanilla mascarpone mousse and a scoop of Greek yogurt sorbet for a bit of flourish and a whole lot of pleasure.",Contemporary,"9 W. 53rd St., New York 10019",112.5,NY,4.5,280,4,2,1,2,112.5,10019
Anchor Oyster Bar,0.0,"Landlubbers seeking a taste of the sea can be found pulling up a stool at this Castro institution, where waves of waiting diners spill out the doors. This tiny, minimally adorned space filled with old-fashioned charm is better for twosomes than groups. While the menu may be petite, it's full of fresh fare like a light and flavorful Dungeness crab ""burger"" on a sesame bun; Caesar salad combining sweet prawns and tangy anchovy dressing; or a cup of creamy Boston clam chowder loaded with fresh clams and potatoes. As the name portends, raw oysters are a specialty, so fresh and briny that the accompanying mignonette may not be necessary.

Stop off at the circular bar and join the well-heeled couples sipping cocktails pre- or post-opera. Prime seats on the upstairs balcony overlook the bustling lower level, and stunning arched windows show off views of the street. Approachable, seasonal dishes abound on Jardinière's menu, from tender tajarin pasta with morel mushrooms and butter to a Mediterranean-inspired duo of lamb belly and shoulder with fresh fava beans and smoked yogurt sauce.

This iconic space embraces its unique shape, and is styled with bold artwork-covered walls, a copper bar counter, and wood-burning oven sending out delightful pizzas and filling the room with mouthwatering aromas. Given its ace location, Zuni makes for a divine lunch destination-and proof is in the many business folk, trendy ladies-who-lunch, and tourists that fill its tables midday.

Cook St. Helena,0.0,"An artistically lit antelope head hangs in this Italian haven on St. Helena's main drag. Random? Not really, when one considers how rare solid cooking and sane prices can be in this tony burg. The cozy space has two seating options: a gleaming marble counter as well as tables that stretch from front to back (the ones up front are lighter, airier, and more preferable). The food is thoughtful and refined with a daily rotating risotto, house-stretched mozzarella and burrata, and glorious pastas like ricotta fazoletti with a deeply flavored Bolognese.

The classic bistro accoutrements (yellow walls, wooden tables, framed retro posters) are present and accounted for, but there's an element of quirky fun here as well-from the flower-bedecked bicycle out front to the porcelain hens and hogs that dot the dining room.

Inside, closely-spaced tables are ideal for an intimate meal, and local residents definitely know it, because reservations are always hard to come by. Frascati's fare may not be the city's most innovative, but it is very satisfying, thanks to well-made classics like tender potato gnocchi with asparagus and peas in thyme-white truffle butter, or grilled duck breast in pomegranate sauce over hearts of palm and herb spaetzle. Split the luscious pain perdu, caramelized sponge cake soaked in citrusy crème anglaise, and let the friendly servers and soft lighting work their magic.",Mediterranean,"1901 Hyde St., San Francisco 94109",37.0,CA,4.4,107,3,65,0,0,37.0,94109
Perbacco,0.0,"Slick financial types flex their expense accounts at this longtime Northern Italian favorite, whose polished décor belies an extensive menu of house-made pastas and comfort fare like roast chicken and meatballs at lunch, with slightly more refined takes at dinner. Dishes are executed with care-from mortadella-stuffed, black truffle-topped quail to handmade pastas, though portions can be a little scant. The space is larger inside than it looks, with plenty of booths and seats at the marble bar up front, and buzzy tables in the back with a view of the open-plan kitchen. Well-versed servers will encourage saving room for the end of the meal-as the cheese display, an impressive selection of grappas, and the inventive, delicious desserts are all highlights.",Italian,"230 California St., San Francisco 94111",37.0,CA,4.2,208,3,54,0,0,37.0,94111

Find straightforward pleasure in the grilled free-range chicken BLT on a griddled bun with crisp fries. For dessert, don't miss the rustic ginger cake with pumpkin ice cream and caramel.

Attractive and comfortable, the industrial setting embraces its past as a former printing warehouse with details like wide plank and exposed brick flooring. While the atmosphere is business-friendly at lunchtime, with elegant fare like a bruschetta of grilled sourdough bread and decadent burrata drizzled with quality olive oil and syrupy balsamic, it amplifies when the after-work crowd streams in.

On warm days, diners scramble to score one of the sidewalk tables, though the traffic on busy Shattuck Avenue might dispel any fantasies of the Champs-Élysées. The fare, like the décor, is classic French, with dishes like escargots in garlic butter and a croque monsieur oozing with Emmenthaler cheese. At dinner, hearty boeuf bourguignon and steamed mussels in garlic and white wine send diners into Gallic reveries.

Rustic American food with a hint of Italian flair dominates the menu and the local Belfiore burrata-served atop diced pears, honey-cashew cream, and peppery arugula-is a surefire hit. Then pappardelle may arrive tangled in an intensely flavored veal ragù, enriched with spicy chili flakes and parmesan.

Waits are inevitable without a reservation, but the engaging staff keeps things hopping. Ad Hoc's breezy prix-fixe menu boasts four delicious courses (three at brunch), kicking off with a salad like the luscious heirloom tomato, arugula, and pickled red onion. The famous fried chicken, now served nightly, is tender, spicy, deeply flavorful-and well worth the additional cost. Be sure to save room for dessert, because you'll want to linger over a wedge of the decadent peanut butter pie.

The Restaurant at Meadowood,3.0,"Located in a sprawling verdant resort amid mountains and vineyards, Meadowood is the peak of wine country-chic. The bar and lounge resemble a plush mountain lodge, thanks to fireplaces, vintage books, and soft leather seating. Their extraordinary dining room boasts a lovely backlit vaulted ceiling over tables made from granite and columns of Canadian redwood. Every detail conveys American beauty and grace; service is usually faultless, anticipatory, and adept. Chef Christopher Kostow's cuisine is not only stunning to behold but thoroughly delicious. Sample a ring of buttery Gwen avocado enhanced with Rancho Chimiles walnut oil and containing a perfectly chilled oyster as well as a few sea beans for exquisite crunch and flavor. Next, chunks of silky and translucent lobster are paired with crispy, sweet chestnuts and lemony purslane for a decadent study in texture, and work as a perfect foil to a simple yet sublime duck tea (a clear yet intense broth) with nothing but a few dill fronds for finish. For dessert, silken chocolate custard with a potent dark chocolate sauce, fudgy dates, and sweet roasted chocolate panettone is a hauntingly complex pleasure on a plate.",Contemporary,"900 Meadowood Ln., St. Helena 94574",112.5,CA,4.8,40,4,32,1,2,112.5,94574

Kudos to the amiable host staff for handling them smoothly. The dark wood interior is clubby yet accommodating, and a large patio offers drinks for waiting diners. Every portion here can easily serve two, beginning with a seasonal vegetable platter boasting buttery Brussels sprouts, a wild rice salad, and braised red cabbage. For those looking to stave off tasting-induced hangovers, the steak and enchilada platter is the ticket with plenty of juicy tri-tip, yellow and red escabeche sauce, and a poached egg.

Dinner always commences with fluffy house-made focaccia, a favorite among regulars. From there, choose from other delectable offerings like deliciously briny spaghetti with clams and mussels or tender, lightly crisped veal cutlets Saltimbocca, oozy with Prosciutto di Parma and provolone.

Willi's Wine Bar,0.0,"Don't be fooled by the roadhouse vibe at Mark and Terri Stark's flagship spot, which actually boasts an extremely well-traveled menu. The eclectic dishes are meant to be shared-and paired with local wine, naturally-and the clean, comfortable environs, rich with dark wood, create an ideal setting for a fun evening out with friends. Willi's wide-ranging menu isn't afraid to take inspiration from wherever it comes-whether adding pancetta and sherry vinegar butter to scallop dumplings; or piling Dungeness crab, baby artichokes, and crescenza cheese on a puffy flatbread. To really indulge, opt for the warm spinach salad with goat cheese and dates, before digging into the Meyer lemon pudding cake, with its airy top and delightful lemon curd.",International,"4404 Old Redwood Hwy., Santa Rosa 95403",37.0,CA,4.4,84,3,52,0,0,37.0,95403
Risibisi,0.0,"Though it's named for a comforting dish of rice and peas, Risibisi's seafood-heavy take on Italian cuisine is a bit more sophisticated. A meal at this Petaluma treasure might begin with tissue-thin morsels of fresh salmon carpaccio mingled with julienned celery; or blanched potato salad tossed with an orange-herb vinaigrette and zesty horseradish cream. Gnocchi with chunky wild boar ragù are so light and tender that it somehow seems easy to finish the generous portion. End with their house-made tiramisu or cannoli, and feel like you were transported to Italy. A makeshift picture gallery constructed out of salvaged Tuscan chestnut window frames, wine barrels, and wagon wheels bring character to this inviting brick-walled dining room.",Italian,"154 Petaluma Blvd. N., Petaluma 94952",37.0,CA,4.1,38,3,54,0,0,37.0,94952
Kyo Ya,1.0,"In the basement level of a classic walk-up smack in the midst of a hip-artsy downtown neighborhood, Kyo Ya looks and feels like a secret hideaway cloaked in undulating wood and dark slate. The height of professionalism and hospitality, the staff is not merely attentive but appreciative of your presence at their table-or perhaps at one of the prized chef's counter stools for kaiseki dining, where mesmerizing craft is exhibited. This is a place where traditional cuisine is prepared with modern flair, and Japanese is the moneyed clientele's mother tongue. Refinement pervades every element of every dish, like the delicate, slightly tart pickled cabbage potage with chewy tri-colored taro root-potato dango and pale green strips of simmered vegetables finished with a dab of miso. The sashimi of the day may feature a fresh oyster with sautéed onion and yuzu kosho oroshi swimming in ponzu; simmered firefly squid and celery topped with salty karashi-miso and pickled plum; or tender raw octopus. Clay pots reveal fragrant dashi cooked with woodear mushooms, carrots, turnips, and bobbing with a tiny melting ball of excellent mozzarella as well as the quenelle-like shrimp dumpling, ebishinjo.",Japanese,"94 E. 7th St., New York 10009",62.0,NY,4.6,59,4,55,1,1,112.5,10009
Soto,2.0,"Culinary dominance, unmistakable skill, and absolute discipline permeate every angle of this modest storefront. This is not some flashy temple to sushi, but rather an authentic and visually restrained rendering of a traditional Japanese restaurant. If the sterile look (with just blonde wood and bright lights to embellish) seems too antiseptic, then remember that Soto prides itself on precise preparations of luxurious raw seafood. While operational issues combined with lackluster service may have impacted guests' experiences of late, the cuisine of Chef Sotohiro Kosugi remains extraordinary-as long as you can tune out the flaws. Knife skills are paramount and every element is at its precise temperature, as these adept cooks coax each morsel of impossibly rich uni, served simply with uni powder, into a single bite that leaves a lasting impression. Composed dishes are not only strikingly beautiful, but an outright hit-imagine finely chopped and exceedingly silken toro tartare with avocado coulis, caviar, and chives accompanied by a sesame-ponzu sauce. And, unctuous fresh water eel combined with Tosa vinegar, smoky bonito flakes, and crisp Japanese cucumbers come together to form a neat but umami-rich finish.",Japanese,"357 Sixth Ave., New York 10014",62.0,NY,4.1,60,4,55,1,2,112.5,10014
SPQR,1.0,"Pleasant and homey with excellent Italian cooking, there is little wonder why this destination is always bustling. Book in advance and assume that the dining counter reserved for walk-ins is already overflowing for the night. The space itself is narrow with tightly packed wood tables and furnishings; it would seem cramped were it not for the soaring ceiling, skylights, and open kitchen to brighten the mood. This is a place where passion and enthusiasm for Italian specialties are palpable-even contagious. From piccolo (snacks) to dolce, the extensive menu evolves with the seasons, yet remains consistently good. Memorable pastas may include forest mushroom-stuffed francobolli ravioli tossed with more mushrooms and dark Umbrian lentils beneath a melting layer of espresso BellaVitano. Follow this with a tasting of goat, perhaps including fennel-infused sausage, roasted rib chops, and an exceptional roulade of smoked belly meat served with jammy-sweet quince saba, caramelized cippolini, bok choy, and quince mostarda. Desserts may seem unassuming but are beautifully composed, like the persimmon torta with torched marshmallow, walnut-praline powder, and caramel ice cream.",Italian,"1911 Fillmore St., San Francisco 94115",62.0,CA,4.1,261,4,54,1,1,112.5,94115
Waterbar,0.0,"Stunning views of the Bay Bridge are the chief draw at this Embarcadero fave for sipping wine on the lovely terrace and slurping oysters at the enormous raw bar. Though the polished, modern dining room can seem serious (as can the expense account-rocking prices), warm and thoughtful service brings things back down to earth. Seafood-centric entrées make global use of the local waters' bounty by way of tender squid almost bursting with chorizo alongside candy-like chickpeas. Perfectly crisp pan-roasted striped bass atop flavorful wild rice oozes with delectable flavors and textures; and an Americana-influenced dessert menu (think carrot cake ice-cream sandwiches with rum-raisin sauce) is the final touch in ensuring that Waterbar stays packed to the gills.",Seafood,"399 The Embarcadero, San Francisco 94105",62.0,CA,4.3,276,3,91,0,0,37.0,94105

The food is always top-notch, but the vibe remains casual, with families enjoying dinner and couples with dogs in tow benefitting from the spacious patio. Efficient servers bustle between tables inside the colorful room, flooded with light thanks to walls of windows.

The simple dining room and heated, covered outdoor patio are favorites among the Sonoma locals. They flood this café for the freshest ingredients from area producers, served at moderate prices by a welcoming, genuine waitstaff. The menu keeps pace with the seasons, but might include a roasted pear topped with potent black truffle-goat cheese and crispy prosciutto, or juicy, perfectly cooked duck breast over crunchy green romanesco and golden-crusted sweet potatoes.

Momofuku Ko,2.0,"David Chang's beloved Ko has packed up its 600-square-foot tasting course concept and moved a few blocks south. Down a quiet alley and behind a door sporting his proverbial peach, you'll find the handsome new digs: a street-hip space sporting 40 seats, 22 of them surrounding the open kitchen via a U-shaped counter made of smooth black walnut. Much else remains the same. Per the old rules, there is no à la carte-only the multicourse menu for the evening (which you're given in print before you go). Then, dishes are delivered by the chefs themselves, who briefly describe each ingredient; while servers slip seamlessly between guests, changing silver and filling drinks. Chang is a veritable rock star chef by any standard (and his longtime lieutenant Sean Gray is the chef's equivalent of Keith Richards), so you're in expert hands from the start. Fresh, sweet sea bream is bound by translucent grated yam with fragrant shiso and pops of finger lime; and tender beef tartare is paired with cream of oyster as well as crushed popcorn. Delicate kabocha squash tortellini arrives with shaved parmesan and agrodolce; and a perfectly seared slice of venison is paired with silky potatoes and earthy Époisses.",Contemporary,"8 Extra Pl., New York 10003",112.5,NY,4.5,164,4,2,1,2,112.5,10003
Sushi Azabu,1.0,"Like a little secret tucked beneath Daruma-ya, this standout sushi den has a serene look and private feel that is intimacy incarnate. This works out well, since the subterranean room can only seat about a dozen guests. The changing roster of Japanese chefs maintain their mystical composure beneath the dark painting of a carp behind the counter, fostering a relaxed pace to each meal even as orders pile in from upstairs. True, they may be serving the same quality fish as the spot above, but the omakase dishes here are incomparably superior. This is immediately clear from the first bit of otoshi, house-made silken tofu with the bold flavors of sea urchin and salmon roe, finished with bits of crisped nori. The kitchen's seasonal influences may be reflected in a springtime bowl of bamboo shoots braised in smoky dashi, or a delicate cube of steamed Japanese red snapper in soy-ginger broth with grated turnip and a fragrant, bright green cherry leaf. The array of sushi includes an explosively briny giant clam, sea scallop with grated yuzu on perfectly cooked rice, and raw sweet shrimp that is downright knee-weakening. The miso soup is the best you've had in a long time.",Japanese,"428 Greenwich St., New York 10013",112.5,NY,4.5,47,3,55,1,1,62.0,10013
Pampas,0.0,"Pampas has a prime Palo Alto location across from the Caltrain, just steps from the shops on University Ave. The large brick façade is hard to miss, and judging by the half-off happy hour crowds, most yupsters don't. The voluminous, bi-level restaurant has the look of a sexy barn with dark masculine furnishings. Pampas is a Brazilian churrascaria (carnivore heaven) where servers bring tender, well-seasoned, spit-roasted rodizio meat until you say ""uncle."" Standouts include the tenderloin filet seasoned with garlic and herbs; chicken legs marinated in garlic, chiles, and vinegar; and house-made chorizo with harissa and more chiles. In case this isn't enough, the sidebar buffet is unlimited. And, the slow-roasted pineapple makes an excellent finale.",Brazilian,"529 Alma St., Palo Alto 94301",62.0,CA,4.2,295,3,16,0,0,62.0,94301
Dovetail,1.0,"Serious but never pretentious, Dovetail is a well-frequented culinary destination. Don't be duped by its slight façade, as the seriously overhauled space within now feels much more spacious, ultra-warm, and very chic. Then consider the delightfully accommodating and well-orchestrated staff only to find that it all comes together in perfect harmony. Menus are handsomely bound in leather and highlight remarkably unique, ingredient-focused treats like a chickpea panisse coupled with garlicky aïoli; wedges of cool and tender chayote topped with crunchy pumpkin seeds and a creamy pumpkin purée; or king trumpet mushrooms coasting alongside paper-thin shavings of Asian pear, finished with an earthy and silky sunchoke paste. One large and plump potato raviolo, filled with creamy herb-flecked ricotta and floating in a pool of potato foam, is topped with a deep-fried sage leaf, which in turn makes for an ideal counterpoint to the rich layer beneath. Feeling self-righteous after such a wonderfully wholesome feast? You may look forward to some good old-fashioned decadence by way of a bittersweet chocolate soufflé-very light, delightfully frothy, and enriched with just the right dab of cardamom-cocoa nib ice cream.",American,"103 W. 77th St., New York 10024",62.0,NY,4.4,126,4,2,1,1,112.5,10024

Pasta fiends will swoon for house-made tagliatelle in a meaty beef and pork sugo, while butter-roasted chicken boasts juicy meat, golden-brown skin as well as fresh peas and asparagus alongside. Soul-warming in its hospitality, Corso is the kind of place where servers will bring complimentary pistachio biscotti simply because they're ""so good when they're warm."" It's no surprise that the tiny trattoria is a favorite among new couples, so be sure to reserve in advance and come hungry.",Italian,"1788 Shattuck Ave., Berkeley 94709",37.0,CA,4.1,79,2,54,0,0,37.0,94709

Flavorful bouillabaisse packed with fresh dorade, plump scallops, and local shellfish; or a beet-and-apple salad with mandarinquats and goat cheese; sealed by a tangy, buttery lemon tart are only some of the appealing menu options. Le Garage's building was used to construct World War II battleships, but these days, it's more likely to house well-dressed sailors fresh off their yachts in the harbor, as well as lunching locals from the neighboring businesses.

Tempting small plates include smoky caramelized coca (flatbread) with garlicky house-made txistorra pork sausage, Manchego, and sliced summer squash. Simple yet delicious offerings go on to feature slices of crusty levain topped with smashed fresh peas, roasted porcini, trumpet mushrooms, and more Manchego shavings.

The seafood cassolette brings together plump prawns, huge mussels, and flaky fish over a bed of mashed potatoes, then swaths them in a velvety lobster bisque reduction. A floating island of caramelized meringue is especially indulgent, when served in a pool of crème anglaise with strawberries and caramel sauce.

Kick off a meal here with a fresh and vibrant panzanella packed with sweet heirloom tomatoes, diced cucumber, and shaved salty ricotta salata. Parsley-infused fettuccine is equally delightful, twirled with garlicky olive oil, mushrooms, and a dusting of truffled pecorino cheese.

Diners come in big groups to feast on Mexican and Latin cooking, aided by freshly squeezed margaritas and 101 tequilas. The décor is comfortable, with booths that boast a view of Marinitas' fun knickknacks and huge angled mirrors donning the walls. Considering the crowds, the food here is still made with great care, from that cocktail glass of creamy Peruvian-style salmon ceviche with aji amarillo and citrus, to tender braised pork tinga over sweet corn polenta.

Even the wine list features his house blends, which pair nicely with pastas like whole-wheat tagliarini tossed in a pitch-perfect Bolognese.

The food is playful and globally inspired, from pastrami-style salmon tartare with warm brioche and creamy dill crème fraîche to a panzanella with arugula, cherry tomatoes, and pan-fried chicken breast.

Others go for the juicy jerk chicken with a kick of heat, cooled by mashed yams and pineapple-red onion salsa. The earthy, well-seasoned black-eyed pea salad is another favorite-and fittingly so.

Kajitsu,1.0,"It's the way of the modern world that we think of the changing of the seasons more in terms of our wardrobe rather than our food-but a meal at Kajitsu could change that. This Japanese vegan restaurant serves shojin cuisine based on the precepts of Buddhism-if you're in search of an antidote to the plethora of steakhouses in the city, this is it. The second floor, traditionally decorated space is a sanctuary of peace and tranquility and offers table or counter seating and service that is as charming as it is earnest. Such is the skill of the kitchen you'll forget in no time about the absence of fish or meat. It's all about balance, harmony and simplicity-and allowing the ingredients' natural flavors to shine, whether it's the delicate onion soup with mizuna and potato, or the visually arresting hassun which could include everything from mountain yam to burdock root. Your period of contemplation and newfound respect for your fellow man may come to a juddering halt when you find yourself back on Lexington but, for a few moments at least, you'll feel you connected with nature.",Japanese,"125 E. 39th St., New York 10016",62.0,NY,4.4,30,4,55,1,1,112.5,10016
Minetta Tavern,1.0,"While this 1937 setting has been restored and refreshed, nothing here changes and that is its beauty. This quintessential New York tavern is still surrounded by dark wood, checkerboard tiled floors, and those framed caricatures. The astute service team handles the crowds and energy as well as ever-they even don the same white-aproned livery seen in Mad Men. It's that kind of place. The menu's dedication to bistro classics and New York steakhouse fare ensure its continued longevity. A thick slice of their mosaic-like terrine of oxtail, poached leek, and carrot surrounding a foie gras center is timelessly good. Those warm platters of juicy, tender, appetizingly charred New York strip steaks propped up against a bouquet of peppery watercress shine with simple, perfect flavor. An oval cast-iron pan of slow-cooked pork shank is rendered tender, luscious, and dark as a prune. Piping-hot pommes aligot are just what mashed potatoes were always meant to be: cheesy, creamy, and obscenely decadent. Velvety bittersweet chocolate soufflés and towering wedges of bright white coconut cakes stacked with three layers of pastry cream, tart crème fraîche, and coconut shavings are brazen crowd-pleasers.",Gastropub,"113 MacDougal St., New York 10012",62.0,NY,4.2,347,3,44,1,1,37.0,10012
Marea,2.0,"There are some restaurants that have a discernible pulse that makes you immediately aware you've arrived somewhere a little special. At this elegant and refined Italian restaurant you aren't so much as welcomed in as taken in hand and enveloped in a sort of benevolent bubble of care. It's a grown up establishment with a suitably urbane clientele who all look at home in this part of town. Sit in the main dining room where all the action happens, rather than in the alcove off the bar-which is undoubtedly-Siberia. As the name suggests, seafood and shellfish lie at the heart of the menu. And needless to say, the ingredients are not only of irreproachable quality but are also treated with respect and deftness by the kitchen, whether it's the brilliant white halibut or the salt-baked wild bass. Start with the crudo, and then head for a generous bowl of homemade pasta such as tagliolini with clams and calamari, followed by a whole fish or a classic entrée. It's not of course compulsory to stick to fish-the lamb chops make a worthy alternative.

Though the menu may be unfamiliar to Western palates, Battambang boasts warm, hands-on service that will make any diner feel at ease. Don't let its gaudy exterior deter you: the interior is pleasant and tastefully adorned. The must-order here is the amok trei, a hard-to-find dish of catfish steamed in a fragrant banana leaf. Layered with red lemongrass sauce and coconut milk, it's utterly beguiling. Equally good is the spicy-sour yihoeur char tumpaing, a stir-fry of calamari and bamboo shoots with lemongrass and ground chili. Adventurous diners should also sample the omelet-like num banchev, an eggy rice-flour crêpe with chicken, prawns, sprouts, and a strong, funky fish sauce.",Cambodian,"850 Broadway, Oakland 94607",18.5,CA,4.2,33,2,24,0,0,18.5,94607

The food is an authentic culinary journey through the Eternal City, with favorites like perfectly al dente bucatini all'amatriciana, twirled with smoked pancetta, sweet onion, tomato, and chili.

George Mendes' cheerfully run restaurant may not necessarily transport you there but you will leave here feeling as though your serotonin levels have received a timely boost. Those who like to eat whilst deciding what to eat should head straight for the appealing Portuguese selection of petiscos, or snacks-the croquetas de bacalhau and the Serrano ham are good. The main menu is seasonally pertinent and full of dishes to match that southern European climate: they are bright, sunny, and you feel they are doing you good. Nothing says the Med more than sardines-and here they come expertly filleted and dressed with dill and bronzed fennel. But even when the sun's gone down, the kitchen is equally adept at more warming, comforting dishes-try the venison with Swiss chard and chestnuts. The restaurant comes decorated with birch wood and shades of blue and is spread over two narrow rooms. Thanks to the open kitchen, the first floor has more buzz but if you're on a date, ask for the mezzanine level which is a little more intimate.",Mediterranean,"31 W. 17th St., New York 10011",62.0,NY,4.0,88,3,85,1,1,49.5,10011

Neophytes have nothing to fear here as there's a veritable army of charming, clued-up helpers and servers to guide you effortlessly through each and every dish. And guidance is certainly needed because the only menu you'll see is the one presented to you like an award certificate as you leave. The cooking is strikingly original and very clever.

Atwood's brasserie menu isn't exactly full of surprises, but its familiar foods are given first-class upgrades-think pancetta-studded mac and cheese; lamb chops with basil and preserved lemon; and an omelet with crunchy bacon, creamy Brie, and verdant asparagus.

Then, deliciously tender and evenly pink Colorado lamb is served with a harmonious hodgepodge of creamy yogurt, charred lettuce, and nearly sweet baby potatoes.

Don't panic at the length of the lines: they are long but move fast, and free doughnut holes (one of the restaurant's signature baked goods) make the wait go faster. Back to those omelets: they may be made with mere eggs, like everyone else's, but somehow these are lighter and fluffier, almost like a soufflé, stuffed with feta, spinach, onions, or any other ingredients of your choice. They arrive in skillets with an Idaho-sized helping of potatoes. The best part? Everyone gets a swirl of soft-serve at the meal's end.",American,"565 W.

Mexique,0.0,"Large groups fill most of the banquettes in this slender space, but a bar stretching half the length of the room makes it easy for smaller parties to stop in for a glass of sangria. A large rear window offers a glimpse of Chef Carlos Gaytan at work in the kitchen, and congratulatory graffiti from visiting chefs provides a fun distraction on the way to the restroom. Many of Mexique's contemporary Mexican dishes are inspired by classical French techniques. From the platos fuertes, the mar y tierra is a delightful composition of Michoacán-style braised pork belly over silken sweet potato purée dressed with a complex dark mole prepared from over 20 ingredients; sea scallop with bacon-apple jam and pickled onions complete this intoxicating one plate feast.",Mexican,"1529 W.

NAHA,1.0,"There's a quiet elegance to Chef Carrie Nahabedian's dining room, a sleek, window-wrapped space with contemporary accents of concrete, wood, and greenery. Here, patrons aren't groupies checking off the latest table on their do list, but rather connoisseurs experiencing a magnificent meal with exceptional service. If your idea of relaxation starts with pre-dinner drinks, the sizable bar and smattering of tables in the front lounge are an open invitation to begin. Despite its understated environs, NAHA's sweeping carte of seasonally driven Mediterranean cuisine is anything but. Shining starters include succulent lamb boereg, a delicate phyllo-wrapped parcel of ground meat plated with strained yogurt, juicy red pomegranate arils, and refreshing watercress salad. Perfectly toothsome and loaded with seasonal produce, the risotto is always a hit, while entrées like pan-seared Arctic char dressed with beluga lentils, mustard seeds, and savory apple-celery broth are a breath of fresh air. Dessert highlights include the house sundae-a perennial favorite that's reimagined each season-and the gâteau Basque, a warm vanilla custard cake served with brown butter ice cream, corn pudding, and cubed pears.",American,"500 N.

Inside, the bi-level room wears a crisp style à la high ceilings, eminently comfortable leather seats, and a soft azure-blue color scheme. If the décor doesn't transport you to the Mediterranean in a flash, look to the regional Italian menu with ingredients imported directly. A salad of plum tomatoes topped with creamy burrata and fragrant basil in a light dressing is as inherently satisfying. So, too, are pasta signatures including rich risotto alle verdure or creamy ricotta-filled ravioli swimming in a vibrant sauce of spinach and showered with slivers of nutty parmesan.

Here, stacks of bamboo baskets are wheeled to tables on signature silver trolleys for a classic dim sum experience-yet each diner's selection is cooked to order for truly fresh and steaming hot bites. The proof is in the soft and poppable shrimp-and-chive dumplings and the fluffy white buns stuffed with chunks of barbecue pork. Those looking for larger portions will appreciate the meandering menu, which also boasts Hong Kong-style stir-fry and clay pot dishes alongside Americanized Chinese classics.

Like a stylish private club but without the centuries of stuffiness, RL offers options for a quick solo lunch, cocktail at the mahogany bar, or full dinner. The odd Blackhawks jersey here and there doesn't detract from the overall aura. The menu is as classically American as the name, featuring bistro favorites like Waldorf salad and raw bar offerings alongside well-prepared dishes like sweet and plump pan-seared scallops with white balsamic-crème fraîche.

Set inside a 19th century print shop, the historic dining room does a fine job mixing original details with modern touches. Muted tones in the exposed brick walls and custom tile flooring complement newer elements like floor-to-ceiling wine storage and dramatic smoke-shaded chandeliers that drip with crystals. Though the décor may tip its hat to yesteryear, Chef Andrew Zimmerman's cuisine is firmly grounded in the 21st century. Whether you visit for lunch or dinner, meals here always seem to reflect the amalgam of American cuisine, with hints of Southeast Asian, Korean, and Mediterranean tastes. Potato gnocchi may seem commonplace, but this version is memorable thanks to the flawless components and rich, profound flavors of lamb sugo with crunchy bits of ciabatta breadcrumbs. Chicken here is downright exciting, served tender and crisp-skinned with a supremely buttery Albufera sauce, crumbly chestnuts, caramelized fennel, and sausage.

A side of red bliss potatoes sweetens the deal, but if you're really looking for something sugary, the grilled coffee cake is a double-layered cinnamon and cream cheese delight.

After sharing a Moscow Mule in a frosty copper mug, duck fat fries, or monkey bread with dill butter, it might be time for messy elotes tossed with sweet chili jam to be licked off each finger; or an heirloom tomato tart with a SarVecchio cheese crust and shaved onions.

That said, the ubiquitous pig-centric décor gives a more straightforward idea of what you'll find on the menu. As expected, pork takes precedence here with rillettes, platters of paper-thin aged ham slices, and house-made blood sausage to pair with one of the superlative beer selections.

The historic spot, founded in 1941, is boisterous downstairs with the aforementioned regulars and guys grabbing a bite; upstairs is more refined for local politico lunches and a bit of old-school romance at dinner. Gene & Georgetti is a steakhouse with an Italian bloodline, prominently displayed in the heaping helping of fried peperoncini and bell peppers with the signature ""chicken alla Joe.""

Piccolo Sogno's rustic, yet refined menu offers traditional dishes with a twist. A version of the ubiquitous beet salad (both red and golden) is elevated here by shaved fennel, a drizzle of bright citrus oil, and a dollop of creamy, lush buffalo milk ricotta. If you need further encouragement, let us recommend the rabbit.

If feeling overhelmed by the choices, stick to the chef's specialties or go for the prix-fixe and let the kitchen decide.

Inspired by a Chicago beef, this ciabatta roll is moistened with jus, stuffed full of pork, and dressed with sweet peppers and spicy-tangy giardiniera.

A winding staircase leads to a lofty mezzanine. Classic cuts and chops abound, but Rosebud Prime does all of its dishes with panache. Double-cut bone-in lamb chops sport a plump ribbon of fat encircling their delicate, rich centers.

Don't look for modern surprises on the menu; contentment here is attained through uncomplicated but expertly prepared French dishes from frites to frisée.

Familiar favorites and seasonal specials make for a festive mix of adventurous, yet universally pleasing dishes. Flat corn tortillas form a sandwich-style enchilada, stuffed with fork-tender beef brisket and topped with crunchy strands of sweet potato slaw.

The half-and-half sandwich, piled with pulled pork and brisket, is the best of both worlds, with chunky shreds of tender pork and spice-rubbed slices of pink-rimmed beef spooned with vinegary barbecue sauce.

The bar for painstaking detail seems to rise with each dish. Expect a bang of flavor to open your meal, perhaps with a tart layering briny sea trout roe. Signatures like sea urchin piled over toasted brioche with a round of Périgord truffle never lose their impact. However, what was once an endless parade of seafood bites from faraway shores has grown and refined into equally lush mini-entrées. A square of Miyagi beef is whoa-inducing.

While not as glamorous as upscale sister La Costanera, Piqueo's has its own charm, thanks to a quaint atmosphere with wood floors and an open kitchen.

This is largely thanks to the lone chef behind the counter, Katsuhiro Yamasaki; his wife is the one so deftly managing and serving the entire dining room. The location is charmless and the décor verges on nonexistent, but there is a sober elegance here to balance the low-key vibe. The room is fully booked on a nightly basis so reserve in advance. Each month brings a new set menu, perhaps beginning with fresh New Caledonian blue shrimp and squid seasoned with soy, grilled tableside over a heated stone. This may lead to appetizers that highlight pristine ingredients and jewel-like presentation, as in Tasmanian ocean trout sushi topped with mascarpone cheese and olives, or barbecued unagi rolled into an omelet. Comforting and fragrant soups may brim with fine noodles, shimeji mushrooms and duck magret that finishes cooking in the warm broth.

Options change with the season, but true fans know that pizza is a must. Mixed chicory salad with mozzarella di bufala, pickled red chilies, and house-cured salametto is also a crowd-pleaser.

The formal staff tends to diners at white linen-topped tables in the terra cotta-tiled dining room. Chefs in puffy toques man the open kitchen amid shelves of polished copper pans. A wide-ranging menu of modern Italian interpretations takes guests on a whirlwind tour of the boot. Tiny ravioli stuffed with roasted pears are set in a densely flavorful mascarpone cream sauce with toasted pine nuts and strips of sundried tomatoes. A simple caprese salad arrives as three stacks of thickly sliced heirloom tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella, and basil pesto drizzled with balsamic reduction.",Italian,"1014 W.

The vast dining room sets white linen-topped tables amidst dark polished wood and pale walls decorated with a mounted swordfish, fish prints, and model ships. Hugo's bar draws its own crowds with abundant counter seating. The menu focuses on a selection of fish preparations as well as steaks and chops. These are supplemented by stone crab claws, oysters, crab cakes, chowders, and sautéed frog's legs. Speaking of frog's legs, the restaurant takes its name from the nickname of owner Hugo Ralli's grandfather, General Bruce Hay of Her Majesty's Imperial Forces.

Creative Mexican fare begins with the usual suspects like tacos al pastor and piquant, spunky house-made salsa, but unique dishes broaden the offerings. Here, a bowl of fundido is a Latin cousin to spinach-and-artichoke dip, with a blend of tangy cheeses and plenty of roasted poblanos for extra heat. Pan-fried pork tenderloin medallions come smothered in tomatillo sauce alongside drunken beans, bacon-wrapped shrimp, and a side of smashed red potatoes with oozing Chihuahua cheese.",Mexican,"2423 N.

Add choices like meatballs, tendon, flank steak, and even tofu to the cardamom- ginger- and clove-spiced beef broth, which fills a bowl the size of a bathroom sink. Then throw in jalapeños, Thai basil, and mint to your liking. If you're not feeling like pho this time around, snack on spring rolls with house-made roasted peanut sauce; or a plate of lacy banh xeo stuffed with shrimp, sprouts, and herbs.",Vietnamese,"1063-65 W.

Pressed-tin ceilings, mirrors mounted on exposed brick, and narrow plank floors add quaint appeal. Made-to-order breakfast and brunch is served until 2:30 P.M., allowing ample time for Fruity Pebbles French toast or breakfast burritos. Pollo picante quesadillas get a kick from pickled jalapeños and Jack cheese. Sopapillas come in sweet as well as savory varieties like house-made chorizo with scrambled eggs and cheddar.

Many of Taxim's dishes get a modern twist while remaining respectful to the islands' traditional cuisine. Wild Greek oregano and ouzo-preserved lemon offer a perfect balance to roasted Amish Miller Farms chicken; while loukoumades prove that no one can resist fried dough, especially when tossed in wildflower honey and topped with rosewater-infused pastry cream.

The well-edited menu features light, seasonal dishes that are skillfully prepared. Two large pillows of freshly made squash ravioli are garnished with hearty kale pistou, pickled wild mushrooms, and toasted pepitas.

It's the kind of place where remnants of a glorious past live in harmony with more current elements, and where chefs prefer bandanas and beards to toques. Yet, the cuisine is as haute as ever. Millennials never tire of this local hangout and its numerous dining nooks, including the hip and happening bar that pours an exceptional carte of cocktails; a boisterous front dining room; as well as an exposed brick alcove that flaunts both space and privacy. Open from early to late, the jumping tavern cooks up an exciting lineup of truly extraordinary fare. Make a decadent start with duck (pastrami, confit, and heart) in a jar neatly coupled with rice, beans, and potatoes. Black bass, fried oysters, and green tomato chow chow in a Southern pork broth is another rich dish; while buckwheat cannelloni with chickpeas, French feta, and fennel barigoule in soubise is as wholesome as it is heavenly.

Sunny and citrus-hued, it's the kind of place where those who dare to step outside their satay-and-pad Thai comfort zone will be greatly rewarded. Luckily, the extensive menu makes it easy to do just that. Tender egg noodles absorb the fragrant coconut curry in a bowl of kow soy that's redolent of citrusy coriander and served with pickled greens and cilantro.

Though the bar is wall-to-wall on weekends, most weekdays are low-key, with families and groups ready for a casual night out. Fall-off-the-bone baby back ribs are the real deal, made with a sweet and spicy rub, served with their own ""zesty"" sauce or the newer Prohibition version, with brown sugar and a hint of ghost-pepper heat.

The windowed white room is mod and minimalist, allowing the artistry of the Mediterranean-influenced menu to shine brightly at each table. With Tony Mantuano overseeing the kitchen, Italian influences find their way into many seasonal dishes. Charred tomato crème fraîche lends luxurious smokiness and a tart streak to tender chicken Milanese resting on roasted cipollini purée; and agnolotti bursting with a sweet pea-ricotta filling find savory balance with shards of crispy pancetta.

Handsome banquettes and columns wrapped in celadon tiles lend a clubby allure, but the space's buzzy vibe never feels overwhelming. While a bar stretching half the length of the restaurant gets its fair share of happy-hour crowds, the rear dining rooms offer a more relaxed setting. Pub classics with flair define the menu, like malt-battered cod with creamy tartar sauce and parsley-dusted thick-cut fries-a solid rendition of fish and chips.

Though Benny's steaks are the draw, those prime cuts of filet mignon and ribeye are matched by fresh seafood like simply roasted bone-in halibut fillet and classic raw bar towers, along with a variety of pastas and salads.

The expansive dining room is equally elegant and urbane, attracting dates looking for more intimacy or friends catching up over dinner.The chef manning the ship here is Lawrence Letrero, and an evening in his very capable hands might entail a decadently spicy and wonderfully complex starter of shrimp and roasted squash curry.

The seafood is as fresh as the vibe is sultry, with numerous raw and cooked options like tempura rock shrimp tossed with candied walnuts in a creamy honey aïoli; or maki like the ""tail of two tunas"" pairing yellowfin and super white tuna with pickled jalapeños and fried shallots.

Two rooms, each equipped with a bar, make it easy to get started with a strawberry-mint margarita or Mexican beer. Don't let the name change fool you; ¡Hello Tacos! is still everything you've come to love about De Cero over the years. Tacos are made with hand-pressed corn tortillas and ordered individually, letting diners sample a range of fillings including rich duck confit and spicy corn salsa.

Hearty Americana with seasonal accents defines the menu, like a take on biscuits and gravy that integrates plump dayboat scallops and spicy chili oil.

Saison,3.0,"No expense has ever been spared in this massive wow-inducing space. There are enough shining copper pots to supply a village of restaurants in France; wood tables, smart chairs, and faux-fur rugs mean that someone has recently been to Scandinavia. There is also a refreshing breakdown of traditional barriers between the kitchen and dining areas-underscored by the chefs' visits to each table, personally presenting and describing dishes. Dining here is gorgeous; some find the service personalities to be pompous, while others regard them as warm and convivial. However, the blaring 80's soundtrack (if indeed that is your era) keeps the mood lively. One thing that is undeniable is the level of extraordinary skill and detail that Chef Joshua Skenes uses to craft each item on his spontaneous menu. Expect cultured butters and cream, light and infused broths, as well as the smoke of a wood-fired oven to feature prominently. Meals may highlight luscious white sturgeon caviar with crisp potatoes tourné and a dab of cultured cream. Then, sample sweet, tender lobster barely warmed over coals with a savory seaweed dressing and rich lobster-brain sauce.

Simple, well-constructed American fare abounds, with menu mainstays like an heirloom tomato salad with creamy dollops of burrata and crisp, garlicky breadcrumbs; or a perfectly flaky Coho salmon fillet set over earthy black rice, sweet yellow corn, and caramelized summer squash.

A pick-your-own-protein adventure, the menu is organized by ingredient with a dedicated section for goat. Paper-thin goat carpaccio is dusted with fried capers, beads of smoked trout roe, and an olive-maple vinaigrette.

Rabbit ragù clings to delicate parsley-flecked bow tie pasta tossed with Parmigiano-Reggiano and copious handfuls of butter.

It's a spot that's suited for flirty date nights, boisterous dinners, and every occasion in between. As befits the word ""trattoria,"" rustic Italian preparations take precedence, but the simplicity satisfies. Chunks of pork sausage add heft to a heaping bowl of hand-rolled cavatelli bathed in a light tomato cream sauce, and curls of grilled calamari need only a squirt of lemon, splash of olive oil, and sprinkle of parsley to sing.

Non-traditional menu items might miss the mark here and there, but familiar dishes don't disappoint-and neither do the reasonable prices that pull in crowds of regulars. Shredded chicken enchiladas (wrapped with house-made tortillas) balance earthy, complex mole negro with a burst of brightness from radish matchsticks, cilantro, and raw onion; and thick and creamy refried black beans ensure that no one leaves hungry.",Mexican,"1601 W.

Diners do double takes at intriguingly titled dishes that depart from the usual Thai menu. ""Love me tender"" duck is a sweetheart of a meal, featuring fanned duck breast slices with crackling, sugary skin in a citrus-tinged sauce.

Traditional dishes offer the most authentic experience, like sweet and savory bastilla, a flaky pastry starter that's large enough to serve two, stuffed with spiced chicken and dusted with cinnamon.

Locally sourced and organic are the guiding principles behind every ingredient here; many dishes also get a little Latin flavor. Soft avocado wedges are tossed in panko, then flash-fried for a crispy exterior and creamy center. ""Nanadicts"" give a Southwestern accent to eggs Benedict by adding chorizo, corn pupusas, and poblano cream.

However make no mistake: this is no Bugsy Malone speakeasy, but a grown-up version for bar-flies with astute palates. Snack on creamy burrata and shaved ham finished with a swig of extra virgin olive oil before savoring tender, flavorful pork meatballs on a bed of wilted kale with romesco and almond gremolata.

Start with whole kernel-studded cornbread and honey butter, a fitting salvo for a meal steeped in Southern tradition. Sweet potato bisque is poured tableside over cornbread croutons, spicy apple chutney, and fried sage.

Regional Italian favorites from Tuscany to Sicily are represented throughout the menu. A wood-burning oven brings cannellini beans to creamy consistency in a broth for meaty monkfish osso buco.

The patio is even more of a party, and sun-starved Chicagoans can be spotted out there soon after the groundhog has (or hasn't) seen his shadow. Tacos are served individually, thus allowing ample opportunity to graze on the likes of the pollo pibil-achiote- and citrus-marinated chicken thighs steamed in banana leaves, topped with pickled onion slices and cilantro.

Nibble on crispy samosas or onion bhajis (finely shredded onion fritters) teamed with mint chutney. Then soak pieces of buttery naan in rich and vibrant saag bobbing with soft chunks of chicken.

Up a few stairs, a stainless steel communal table offers a view into the semi-open kitchen. Meals usually start with popcorn seasoned with changing flavors like sesame and seaweed-a preview of the menu's mix of American and international ingredients. A fresh oyster trio gets three distinct garnishes: sambal-pickled ginger, tangy apple mignonette, and pork belly with a smoked aroma revealed by lifting a glass cloche.

The lines wouldn't be stretching out the door if the kitchen weren't cranking out kick-ass burgers. The menu features more than a dozen options of 10-oz. monsters served on pretzel rolls with myriad toppings like roasted garlic mayonnaise, house-made hot sauce, and pepper jack cheese.

Intricate tilework and patterned wall hangings offset the closely set linen-topped tables and add touches of elegance to the homey space. A basket of warm pita bread and a bowl of salty Bulgarian feta, parsley, and raw onions sate the appetites of those perusing the kababs on the menu. Succulent, hand-formed lamb koubideh and beef tenderloin skewers are juicy and charred with a hint of spice, and vegetarian offerings like tadiq with ghormeh sabzi play up the textural contrast of crispy pan-browned saffron rice against flavorful stewed spinach.

This is clearly not the place for a pisco sour, but feels like Sundays con la familia where papa a la huancaina doused in amarillo chile, and arroz chaufa with veggies and beef jerky-like strips are merely some of the items on offer.

Taxidermied pheasants keep watch over the room from their high perches, like a Deyrolle curiosity. The kitchen gives classic French cuisine a soupçon of international embellishment.

As with any good diner, breakfast, lunch, and dinner all know how to hit the spot. The deli roasts its own meats and does Jewish-American staples right, from flavorful, crisp-tender potato pancakes to oversized pastrami and brisket sandwiches with all the fixings (slaw, fries, and potato salad).

The ever-changing menu is cohesive with a mix of classics and specialties like sopa azteca, a nourishing pasilla chile broth poured atop crisp tortilla strips, cool avocado, grilled chicken, and jack cheese. A version of the classic from Morelia, enchiladas a la plaza are first flash-fried, then folded over seasoned cabbage, potatoes, and carrots.

Start with the zippy ensalada Papito, packed with avocado, crispy tortilla strips, and cilantro dressing. Then, dig into the giant mushroom quesadilla with Oaxaca cheese or crisp rock cod tacos with chipotle mayo and cabbage slaw. Well-crafted Mexican entrées, a flavorful salsa selection, and a fully-stocked bar further cement Papito's status as a neighborhood favorite spot for a quiet lunch or bustling dinner.",Mexican,"317 Connecticut St., San Francisco 94107",18.5,CA,4.3,78,3,66,0,0,37.0,94107

Cotogna's absolutely delicious menu highlights Chef Tusk's pristine pastas, like rolled casconcelli stuffed with velvety pumpkin purée in sage butter, as well as seasonal starters that include a beautiful chicory salad with sweet red apple, pomegranate, and Piave cheese.

The slate-gray dining room is serene with clean lines drawing the eye across the meticulous design, while the staff is impressively warm and relaxed for a restaurant of this caliber. Chef Corey Lee's nightly tasting menu is a unique marriage of contemporary American and Korean influences and Master Sommelier Yoon Ha oversees an exceptional beverage program. Dishes promise a fascinating interplay of ingredients, as seen in the potato salad crowned with mirin-glazed anchovies and spirals of mild red chili. Find subtlety and elegance in raw fluke seasoned with sesame oil and sandwiched between crisp sesame leaves; while sea bream served in an aged tangerine jus with black trumpet mushrooms is royally decadent.

Lusk's food is American with contemporary touches, from the togarashi and carrot coulis that spikes a highbrow take on shrimp and grits, to the ginger vinaigrette that accents a summery salad of little gem lettuce and heirloom cucumbers.

The vibe is completely casual yet alluring with crowds riveted by the altar-a tiled turquoise oven, where Mangieri stretches dough and deftly coaxes the crackling wood fire to produce his perfect pies. Their blistered and puffy crusts sport a delicious char as well as an addictively chewy texture thanks to tangy fermentation. Waits are long, but the hassle is well worth it after one bite of the Filetti, slathered with creamy buffalo mozzarella and juicy cherry tomatoes.

While pies like the Geary with chewy clams, caramelized bacon, and Calabrian chilies, are delicious, this casual spot offers much more than a good slice. Absolute knockouts include tomato-braised chickpea bruschetta, oozing with melted burrata; and a salad of smoky grilled radicchio hearts cut by creamy Pt. Reyes blue cheese. A mix of families, hipsters, and business people fresh from the Moscone Center fill the warm, bi-level space.

As with all Ethiopian restaurants, bring clean hands and leave your fork at home: you'll be dining exclusively with injera, the spongy-sour bread that's traditional to the country. The menu offers many appealing options to scoop, from mild begue tibs (lamb with onions, garlic, and rosemary), to spicy eggplant wot stewed in a piquant berbere sauce. Fried potato slices called dentich tibs are great on their own, but extra tasty when paired with assa tibs, a whole baked fish.

The low-profile entrance adds to the feeling you've lucked upon a special dining secret-assuming you don't stroll right past it, that is. Yakitori are the big draw here, with smoky, salty chicken thighs, necks, hearts, and gizzards arriving fresh off the binchotan.

The interior, when you finally reach it, is utterly spare-the better to showcase steaming bowls of tasty and satisfying soup. Customize your broth (soy sauce, garlic pork, soybean), spiciness, and toppings (like spicy cod roe and kikurage mushrooms), then dive in. The ramen arrives in minutes, loaded with the standard fried garlic cloves, hard-boiled quail egg, scallion, chili, and two slices of roast pork. Your job is to slurp the chewy, delicious noodles (and maybe some seaweed salad or edamame), then hit the road-the hyper-efficient staff needs to keep the line moving, after all.

Only here can a top-notch tamale filled with chipotle pulled pork, green chile, and black beans be followed by cassoulet that would do any Frenchman proud-thanks to its decadent mélange of butter beans, duck confit, and two kinds of sausage. With Italian and American staples in the mix as well, it might sound too eclectic for one meal, but Grace's Table earns its name with charming service and a thoughtful, well-priced wine list to bridge any gaps between cuisines.

It's a fun vibe, as diners are tightly packed at a long counter and communal seating in the chic wood plank encased room, and servers do a good job attending to the crowd. Mediterranean flavors factor prominently in the kitchen's stimulating creations, like a kale and carrot salad dressed with delightfully herbaceous and spicy green harissa as well as sunflower seeds for crunch.

Inventive combinations are the order of the day on both the food and cocktail lists; the Fiery Jalesco gets motors revving with a delicately smoky blend of mezcal, St. Germain, and grapefruit aromatics. Many dishes beg for sharing, like the Calabrese pizzetta that heats things up with spicy sausage and red chili flakes.

Baby back ribs-so tender they're practically falling off the bone-are served with a trio of house-made sauces for dipping and slathering.

The cocktail menu draws inspiration from both South and Central America, featuring a variety of capirinhas and mojitos alongside inventive cucumber-lime and pineapple margaritas.

British-inspired gastropub grub matches the impressive roster of brews and Pimm's cups.

Traditional dishes populate a menu that offers a whirlwind tour of the islands' bold flavors. Tinolang manok, a refreshing take on chicken soup, is redolent with ginger and punctuated by green papaya. Dried taro leaves in laing sa gata lend smokiness to tender, coconut milk-simmered pork and shrimp, and a side of Isla's famous adobo rice, spooned with the classic tart and garlicky pork stew, goes with everything.",Filipino,"2501 W.

Then, walk through a 200-year-old wooden arch and carved panels beyond, seemingly afloat in a reflecting pool, to enter the amber-tinted dining room where tables are luxuriously spaced. The kitchen is patently ambitious and quite successful in presenting a contemporary vision of Indian cuisine. Every dish is thoughtfully composed and highlights only products of top quality. Begin with a thick octopus tentacle sent to the tandoor, emerging crisped, charred, incredibly tender, and served with pickled purple potato as well as herb oil. Murg lababdar tastes of pure elegance in seared and braised de-boned chicken drenched in a sweetly spiced, deeply flavored tomato-onion gravy.

Tulsi,1.0,"Anyone who loves their Indian food but got jaded by the generic ghee-heavy menus of Curry Hill should head along to Tulsi. In place of the seizure-inducing colored lighting, this midtown favorite offers billowing muslin and neutral tones; and instead of the usual Bollywood clichés, it provides tranquil, sophisticated surroundings, and attentive, sweet natured service. The menu is also markedly different from the norm. For the appetizers, the kitchen takes the sort of snacks you can find streetside on Chaupati and, by putting its own spin on them (and using primary ingredients), raises them to new heights-such as with the white beans of ragda chaat, which is a great way to start your meal. You can also go Goan for some Portuguese influence with the succulent shrimp balchao. But, be sure to leave room for authentic goat biryani served on the bone, or something from the tandoor like those tender lamb chops.

Wood-fired sourdough pizzas, like a marble potato pie with fontina, bacon, and a fresh farm egg, are the heart of the menu, accented by antipasti such as shaved Brussels sprouts and pecorino salad or golden cod brandade fritters with a tangy citrus aïoli.

A large chalkboard offers numerous specials, tempting the crowds that flock here each evening.

The upbeat, sun-filled dining room, done in bright orange and yellow and filled with big, bold paintings, is clean and unfussy. The small-town staff are every bit as warm as the space, and treats everyone like a regular. A meal might begin with a mixed-green salad topped with creamy goat cheese, sweet persimmon, bits of prosciutto, and a tart cherry vinaigrette; then segue into a nest of al dente linguine twirled with crumbled merguez and minty feta in a spicy tomato broth. A tender local ribeye is accented by creamy bordelaise and buttery potatoes, then strewn with sautéed broccolini and mushrooms; paired with a Napa red blend, it's equal parts modern and classic.

At this quirky spot, autographed baseballs line the shelves, while photographs and posters of ballplayers paper the walls. But the cluttered décor doesn't deter locals from frequenting this modest yet welcoming joint. Gas grills at each table give off an intoxicatingly savory perfume as patrons take their time searing their choice of well-marbled marinated beef, including the always-popular bulgogi or kalbi, and then cool their mouths with a traditional array of banchan. For those who prefer their meat raw, beef tartare assumes an interesting twist of flavor and texture when folded with Asian pears, sesame seeds, and sesame oil.",Korean,"3752 W.

A blackboard above the semi-open kitchen lists the fresh daily fish and oyster offerings, ready to be shucked, steamed, fried, and grilled for guests lining up at the wood bar that snakes around the room. The casual menu pays homage to classic coastal fish shacks, yet throws in a few gussied-up items like tartare and octopus à la plancha. Bowls of gumbo stick to the classic recipe with zippy andouille sausage, okra, and chunks of blue crab.

Prime steaks, butchered and dry-aged in-house for 35 days, get just the right amount of time under the flame, as is the case with the perfectly cooked-to-order Porterhouse-pre-sliced and plated for each guest.

Shareable farm-to-table dishes appeal to nearly every appetite.

No matter where you sit, the servers are attentive, the linens are thick, chargers are monogrammed with a goldleaf ""F"" and every last detail is very, very lovely. As one might expect of a Michael White restaurant, pastas here are masterful. Begin with perfectly al dente spaghetti evenly coated in subtly sweet tomato sauce with flakey crabmeat, gently spiced red chilies, and grated bottarga. Fish courses can be even more enticing. Dine on some of the brightest, freshest halibut known to this city, served on an excellent mix of smoky butter beans, chopped pancetta, artichokes, crispy golden croutons, and wonderfully minerally cavolo nero.

In a salad of red beets, salty crumbled cotija deliciously offsets those tangy chunks of pickled watermelon; and empanadas are a particular treat, filled with meaty portobellos and creamy potatoes.

Kick things off with the house-made guacamole, mashed to order in a molcajete and spiced to request. Then tuck into tender chicken enchiladas rolled in warm handmade corn tortillas and laced with a smoky chile-ancho sauce; or one of the authentic house specials like tikin xic grouper, a subtle Mayan dish where citrus- and annatto-marinated fish is steamed to delicate and mouthwatering perfection in a banana leaf.",Mexican,"990 Bay St., Staten Island 10305",37.0,NY,4.0,26,2,66,0,0,37.0,10305

Brushstroke,1.0,"The name may not give too much away but as soon as you enter you just know you're in a Japanese restaurant. It's probably all that calming wood-there's enough here of assorted hues and from various sources to excite the woodsman in us all. Or it could be the L-shaped counter behind which chefs go about their work with studied determination; or more probably, it's the sight of graciously polite servers carrying bowls, boards, and cups containing delicate dishes of infinite beauty. This joint venture between David Bouley and Yoshiki Tsuji aims to showcase the beauty, subtlety, harmony, and precision that is Japanese cuisine. This isn't the place for sushi-you go next door for that. Instead, it serves seasonally pertinent dishes that are a joy to behold, but where the art never comes at the expense of taste. The Washu beef sukiyaki, for example, has a wonderful depth of flavor. Desserts, such as sake crème brûlée, have more obvious European parentage but are still light, delicate creations. Indeed, such is the nature of the food here that one can, unlike with many styles of restaurant, still engage in constructive work afterwards.",Japanese,"30 Hudson St., New York 10013",112.5,NY,4.5,65,4,55,1,1,112.5,10013

The well-appointed interior is worlds away from the busy thoroughfare's steady stream of traffic, with linen-draped tables, big blue-cushioned armchairs, and warm, inviting service. Every meal here kicks off with a basket of fluffy flatbread, served with three irresistible dipping sauces. The kaddo, caramelized baby pumpkin and ground beef in a garlic-yogurt sauce, is a perennial favorite, as is the chapendaz, marinated beef tenderloin over a tomato-pepper purée, rice, and lentils.

The serene, ultra-minimalist dining room isn't fancy, with only a few shelves of ceramics as décor. But, older Japanese women in traditional garb who run the show are endlessly polite and attentive so long as you're not raising a din-or requesting a spicy tuna roll. If you're able to go with the flow, you'll find much to adore on their menu, like umami-rich wilted mizuna salad with fresh fava beans and bonito sauce, or pale green edamame tofu with fresh cherries, cherry blossom noodles, and a sour-salty cherry paste.

The menu here is light yet dense with bright flavor, from the crudo du jour (perhaps cubes of hamachi with gently braised cauliflower, pignoli, white raisins, and herbs) to a tender octopus salad with Marcona almonds, arugula, and Jerez vinegar.

The food is light and current and the lunch menu, with dishes taken from the main à la carte, is a positive steal-although the immaculately coiffured clientele did not seem the sort to be overly concerned by the concept of a bargain.

Smoke was a recent inspiration as seen in a slice of brisket afloat in a lusciously fluid risotto of spinach and garlic.

You may feel compelled to order right away as the line out the door makes for a less than leisurely ambience, but relax. The staff is pleasant and the vast menu is worth perusing.

Vegetable antipasti, like spicy spears of pickled fennel, are offered alongside cured meats and imported cheeses.

Carnivores revel in the chef's signature duck tacos juiced with salsa verde, while pescetarians beg for crab Benedict-a superb staple of toasted muffins with sweet crabmeat, soft poached eggs, and spicy Hollandaise.

Pescatarians savor the numerous seafood dishes meant for sharing, but those who forego fish are limited to three meat options. Rectangular crab cakes, stuffed to the gills with sweet meat, get a crunchy sear on all sides.

All the classics can be found here including gumbo, fried alligator, and a perfect jambalaya studded with spicy andouille and tender roasted duck.

Classic chicken under a brick is characteristically on-point: smoky, tender, and served with a squeeze of lemon over nutty farro, Umbrian lentils, and red quinoa salad. Reservations here are a tough ticket, but the attire and vibe are casual and welcoming (if noisy). Can't get a table? Seats at the bar, where the full menu is served, are a solid backup.

The carte du jour is rife with well-executed classics like golden-brown pork wiener schnitzel with a cucumber salad, vegetable strudel, and delectable raspberry Linzer torte.

A well-priced wine list only adds to the elegant appeal. Large chunks of succulent lobster are a luxe touch in a ramekin of tender potato gnocchi bathed in creamy sauce.

Take the time to truly appreciate the philosophy followed at his haute farm-to-table spot, where local, sustainable cuisine combines with a minimalist décor featuring lush earth tones and chandeliers crafted from repurposed jars. Each ingredient-driven dish honors farmers and seasonality. Crisp pan-fried spaetzle, vivid green with mint, steals the show from a duo of mild but meaty lamb sausages, while a pickled pair of golden beets and diced onion provide a light, refreshing counterpoint to Arctic char. Chèvre ice cream rounds out an arrangement of velvety chocolate pavé, buttery graham cracker, salty-sweet caramel, and chewy coconut macarons.",American,"1800 N.

Maude's Liquor Bar,0.0,"Don't be fooled by the aged patina of this sexy boîte: though a few items like the overstuffed curio cabinet and salvaged French metal chairs are true antiques, this chicly disheveled hang has been hiding out on West Randolph for only a few years. Contemporary and classic cocktails like a violet-tinged Aviator are served in champagne coupes, adding to the vintage atmosphere. Head to the second-floor bar to snack on oysters and frites, or fill up on Francophile comfort food under the glow of mismatched crystal chandeliers. Juicy, garlicky Toulouse-style pork sausage is served whole over bacon-stewed lentils, and smashed potatoes are rich with chicken jus.

TAC Quick,0.0,"The focus at this Wrigleyville institution is on speedy, authentic Thai food-and that's exactly what you'll get. Colorful orchids brighten up the minimal space, where solo diners sit at the narrow center bar and people-watchers keep an eye on the hustle and bustle outside from high tables near the windows. Two laminated menus-one with standard fare, and another ""secret"" listing with more traditional dishes-ensure there's something for everyone. It's hard to resist double-dipping a stack of glistening, charred moo ping pork skewers in sour, spicy, and sweet sauce, or finishing every flaky morsel of pad ped pla duk (fried catfish with creamy green curry).

Fat Willy's,0.0,"With piles of hickory and applewood stacked at the entrance and the sweet-spicy aroma of smoke filling the air, Fat Willy's telegraphs an authentic barbecue experience from the outset. Vintage hand mixers decorate one wall, but this isn't a precious farmhouse bakery-the meat is front and center, as indicated by the rolls of paper towels and sheets of Kraft paper laid out over gingham tablecloths. Signature baby back ribs are pink and glistening with fat after a slow smoke, and a duo of house-made barbecue sauces lets diners kick things up as desired. Minced fresh garlic adorns the pulled pork sandwich, with a few shakes of seasoned vinegar for extra oomph.

Take a cue from the regulars and start with galbi, a crave-worthy signature that glistens from a soy- sugar- and garlic-marinade and warrants good old-fashioned finger-licking. Haemul pajeon stuffed with squid and scallions is a crisp, golden-fried delight; and kimchi jjigae is a rich, bubbling, and nourishing broth packed with soft tofu and tender pork. Summer calls for a taste of the bibim naengmyeon-a chilled broth floating with buckwheat noodles, fresh veggies, Asian pear, and crimson-red gochujang all tossed together for a delicious reprieve from the city's sweltering heat.",Korean,"4200 N.

Flickering tea lights on the closely packed bistro-style tables faintly illuminate cozy orange walls painted with food-related quotes. Chef Victor Morenz's eclectic menu picks up influences from around the globe, but each dish is consistently gratifying. Southern meets south of the border in crisp fried oyster tacos with pickled pepper remoulade. Candied kumquats and olive tapenade contrast pleasantly with buttery seared duck breast, and a dense cube of warm, fudgy chocolate cake placed over a swipe of coconut peanut butter is a decadent finale.

The cocktails are good, the noise levels are high, and there are more tattoos in the room than a Yakuza convention. The menu will take forever to read so just go directly to their two specialties-the assorted sushi rolls, some of which use black rice, and meats and fish expertly cooked over an open flame on the seriously hot robata. The ingredients are good and the flavor combinations don't get silly.

The earthy dining area dons a bamboo-lined ceiling as well as a TV monitor that is internally looped to broadcast the kitchen's every move. The ramen offering here differentiates itself by centering on a trio of miso-enriched broths: shiro is a white miso fermented with rice koji (starter); kome-miso is richer tasting; and mame-miso is a strictly soybean product. The mouth-coating soup is delicious alchemy. Each slurp is a multifaceted distillation of pork and chicken bones with savory-salty-sweet notes, stocked with excellent noodles, vegetables, and the likes of panko-crusted shrimp tempura, fried ginger chicken, or slices of house-made cha-su.",Japanese,"129 Second Ave., New York 10003",18.5,NY,4.5,91,1,55,0,0,18.5,10003

Traditional Russian specialties abound with an Olivier salad, salo (house-smoked fatback), borscht, and plump pelmeni served with herbed butter and sour cream.

Pasta plays front and center here and is luckily always handmade. Gorgeous, rose-shaped tortellini are stuffed with mounds of prosciutto and spinach, before being finished by a perfect plum tomato sauce. Secondi are also a must and may include the sublime cotoletta alla Bolognese, a perfectly breaded and pan-fried free-range chicken cutlet topped with a creamy truffle-béchamel sauce and served with a warm spinach budino.",Italian,"126 W. 13th St., New York 10011",37.0,NY,4.1,57,3,54,0,0,37.0,10011

The food here is authoritative and tasty, with a nice representation of Italian cooking from breakfast through dinner. The porchetta panino is timeless, amazing, and vies to be the finest around.

With its faux-farmhouse décor and rather bucolic corner location, it is a go-to neighborhood haunt. Happy hour specials bring them in, but the bar bites make them stay. Every dish on the menu is pleasing, from the buttery lobster puffs perched on champagne cream to the perfectly crafted Mongolian dumplings, full of spicy lamb, cabbage, and onion with a cool soy-lime dipping sauce. The lovely farfalle with fresh favas, sunchoke, spring onion, and chili is bound by a sprinkling of nutty Parmigiano.

Begin with a palate-pleasing surprise in cocktails like the celery gimlet. Then, sample rotating house-made ""pots"" filled with mousses like eggplant topped with sweet-sour relish and taro chips, or chicken liver with port and pepper jelly served with grilled sourdough bread.

The bites here are healthy but equally bright with flavor. Tosta matrimonio is a flax and quinoa crisp topped with black and white anchovies, slow-roasted tomato, and sharp sheep's milk cheese. Also, try bocata de delicata, a satisfying sandwich of slices of charred delicata squash, roasted red peppers, Swiss chard, and cheddar cheese.

It's not polite to discuss age, but let's just say that Chef/grandmère, Marguerite Bruno, has steadily commanded this kitchen for an impressive tenure. The scene is magnifique. Take in the creaky wood floors and parchment-colored walls hung with French-themed jigsaw puzzles, then indulge in chilled silky leeks dressed with the famous house vinaigrette; sautéed veal kidneys in mustard-cream sauce; and steak au poivre with black or green peppercorn sauce.

Nibble on a crispy pile of camphor tea-smoked duck while waiting for the standout items to arrive.

This lady is loved by many, so go with a group to really explore the menu and indulge in authentic japchae stir-fried with beef and veggies, or flaky seafood pancakes.

The ""eight jewels with hot paste"" is a mouthwateringly spiced stir-fry of mushrooms, bamboo shoots, wheat gluten, scallops, chicken, and shrimp.

Inside the large, neatly partitioned space, find rich browns and ivory furnishings with flattering lighting that is just bright enough to see your food clearly. The chairs are deep and tables are well spaced, but request a plush corner banquette for maximum comfort. Even the place settings show sculptural beauty through dark pottery and white porcelain. The ambience is fairly quiet and somewhat reflective. The modern cuisine is confident, complex, and happens to be leaning much more toward Europe than Korea of late. No matter-the cooking remains profoundly enjoyable. At the same time, the most inspired dishes are the ones that retain their heritage, as in the dome of seaweed-seasoned rice with cubes of smoked and torched yellowtail, finished with slivered lettuce. Before the crispy red snapper arrives at the table, hot oil is poured overtop to cook the fish but also to yield incredibly crisped skin, served with a brunoise of hearty greens and potatoes and rich perilla vinaigrette.

The food may be American but seamlessly weaves in Italian influences. Creamy burrata arrives over date purée, glazed in lemon-honey and sprinkled with crushed pistachios. Hake is thickly cut and enticingly flaky, drizzled in brown butter with tart capers, lemon, and parsley, then complemented with both pan-roasted fingerling potatoes and beautifully dressed frisée salad.

The pickled green tea leaf salad combines chopped lettuce, bean sprouts, peanuts, sesame seeds, and bits of tea leaf all dressed with spiced oil and fresh lime. Follow this with mo-goke pork, from the ""land of rubies"" made with tender chunks of meat braised in a salty and sweet dark sauce.

The décor follows suit with a butcher-block table, white wainscoting, dark walls, and wide, comfortable tables. The kitchen promises a focus on carefully sourced organic and biodynamic ingredients-the kind that Granny used. (Evidently, their foremothers had access to quinoa and excellent feta.)

Caserecci tossed with petite, al dente cauliflower florets, capers, currants, and a showering of crunchy breadcrumbs is a treat. Choosing the smaller portion size allows for more room to enjoy the lamb duo-rare seared loin and slow-braised belly-composed with a chickpea-and-piquillo pepper stew slicked with gorgeous lamb jus.

True to its pub spirit, the food keeps pace with the ample beer list with a crackling, tender, and moist crab cake, fried until golden and topped with a deeply spiced remoulade.

The sushi bar tempts with the yakko roll filled with silken house-made tofu and green onion; spicy mushroom roll dabbed with tomatillo purée; and gunkanzushi topped with sweet sea scallop and plump salmon roe alongside soy sauce pre-seasoned with wasabi.

Old-world classics are executed with care; the expertly fried Wiener schnitzel is brightened with a few wedges of lemon and a side of thin, pickled cucumbers.

Small, crisp taquitos de cangrego filled with the perfect balance of sweet crabmeat, salsa verde, white cheese, and crema Mexicana are irresistible.

A sauce-less pizza Bianca, it's strewn with bits of caramelized onions, crumbles of fennel sausage, and gobs of fresh mozzarella and fontina.

Part deli counter, part artsy dining room, and part party hall, Mark Schachner's beloved spot serves up all the classics from beef tongue sandwiches to gefilte fish. The wildly overstuffed sandwiches (all served with homemade pickles and coleslaw) are a home run, as in the pastrami, which is steamed not once but twice, leaving the meat juicy yet hardly fatty. Dive into a Rueben-an open-face and intense pile of juicy corned beef and tart sauerkraut on toasted rye bread, topped with Russian dressing.

Whether or not you can deduce what's on the Cyrillic menu, friendly servers standby, directing guests to native dishes like badrijani, an almost overwhelming helping of eggplant stuffed with fluffy walnut purée.

Platings bring on far-flung influences-as in the bánh Mi(lano), pork terrine, thinly shaved mortadella, and house-pickled vegetables sandwiched into a toasted baguette moistened by a chili-flecked dressing. However, the menu's truest muse is a general coupling of Italian and Spanish flavors, such as pork belly croquetas accompanied by a dipping sauce of crushed chicken livers; or slow-cooked polenta topped with sweet onions caramelized in sausage drippings. The spartanly adorned room offers a hospitable bar in addition to three communal tables.

The gracious, hospitable staff manages to meander through the young professionals and artsy Pratt students with ease, and if the cool charm of SoCo doesn't woo you, the outstanding Southern fare will certainly do the trick: organic buttermilk-fried chicken arrives crispy and tender, and served over a delicious red velvet waffle; while fall-off-the-bone short ribs are braised in an irresistible coconut-molasses-ginger sauce, and served with creamy garlic mashed potatoes and tender okra.

Save for a handful of seats and high-backed wooden booths, a communal table touched by seasonal flora hosts the majority of its occupants. Raw offerings include taco-style sushi, the fish cradled by a sheet of toasted nori, but the menu's crux is on cooked bites-think handmade pork gyoza, kabocha squash simmered in dashi, and nicely done tempura. A truly special treat here is the udon, a tangle of plump, chewy house-made noodles crafted from California-milled flour and filtered water bobbing in luscious broths.

The view alone sets this darling apart from the host of Greek restaurants that popularized Astoria as a dining destination. Yet the food offers its own view of Greek cuisine. Here, East meets West in a menu section reserved for Turkish classics with a unique spin, such as midia dolma or mussels with pine-nut studded rice. Other usual suspects also make an appearance including tzatziki with cucumber, lemon, and garlic-a marvelous accompaniment to zucchini-and-cheese croquettes.

Most everyone here begins with a selection from the pickled menu-curried apples, mushrooms-perhaps to pair with the house chicken liver or country pâté (sadly, most of the charcuterie is no longer made in-house).

Flavors of the Yucatán abound here, from a heap of succulent cochinita pibil, to panucho pockets filled with a delicious black bean purée and topped with chicken and avocado. For extra heat, add a drop or two of the house-made habanero sauces.

A glass of Amarone with a dry-aged Porterhouse is always a slam-dunk, but the kitchen also turns out pleasing modern twists on steakhouse classics. Chicago's famous Italian beef gets an upgrade with smoked ribeye and aged provolone.

Under the direction of Jean-Georges Vongerichten, the seasonal American menu is as casually riveting as the décor.

Otherwise, the focus is kept on the itamae in colorful chef's coats and the pristinely fresh seafood they're preparing. Purists love the well-priced nigiri, sashimi, and manageably sized rolls showcasing silky hamachi or glistening uni with a touch of minerality. Tiger Eyes salad is a visual showstopper: squid stuffed with smoked salmon, julienned cucumber, and marinated carrots sliced into thin rounds are a clever and flavorful resemblance to an orange-pupiled eye.",Japanese,"2206 N.

For a front row seat of the action, sit at the surrounding counter topped with charred shou-sugi-ban wood. With such a prominent display, guests would be remiss not to try choices from the robata.

Exposed brick walls and walnut floors are typically lovely, but do little to soften the din of a happy hour crowd after a few glasses of sherry. Classic tapas as well as ham-and-cheese flights comprise the menu, along with larger plates like a piled-high paella with rabbit, duck, and chorizo. Shell out a few extra dollars for crusty bread to sop up the garlicky, lemony olive oil that bathes their plump head-on shrimp.

The buzzing and open kitchen located up front is the focal point of the space. The energy is palpable, and a night out at this popular spot can feel (in the best way possible) like you've scored a ticket to a very cool party. The bright, industrial-chic dining room features countrified yet sleek wooden tables; and playful pegboard walls showcasing intricate wire sculptures. The easygoing army of servers roll the kitchen's seasonal American small plates around dim sum-style on trolleys (or carry it by foot), showcasing each menu item with an accompanying price tag. It's hard not to want a taste of everything on offer, which is probably even more reason to come with as many friends as you can rally. A quenelle of rich squab liver pâté is spread on sweet almond cakes; while plump Guinea Hen dumplings are served in a fragrant hen broth.

But unlike some cityside establishments, the staff here is personable and enthusiastic, and there's plenty of breathing room (including a private area that's popular for events). Artisan pizzas are the main draw, like a sassy spin on ""eggplant parm"" with coppa, basil, crispy breadcrumbs, and fried garlic. But don't let that limit your choices, as the house-cured salumi, fresh pastas, and alluring antipasti (think chilled corn soup with house bacon and pickled chanterelles) are also winners.

Goosefoot,1.0,"This understated plate-glass façade may seem lost in a sea of mediocrity, but the restaurant it houses is truly distinct. The soothing décor appears minimal, with splashes of orange banquettes, bare tables, and Rodin replicas to fashion a space that is instantly likeable. Menus are made of planting seed paper that guests are encouraged to take home, soak, and use to grow their own wildflowers. Dishes are intricate and take time for the well-versed staff to describe, which may explain the relatively slow pace of dining here. The nine-course menu showcases noteworthy Chef Chris Nugent's classical edge and contemporary artistry. Start with a plump, butter-poached scallop seared until golden, set in a lobster-rich and coconutty sauce with maitake mushrooms and curry spices, surrounded by edible flower petals placed in gels redolent of lemongrass. This may be followed by a unique egg and shell presentation of black garlic custard dotted with shrimp, tucked with an enticingly sharp sprout purée. Superb cheese and dessert courses are a consistent highlight. Goosefoot is still BYO, but an attached wine shop ensures that no one is caught empty-handed.

Service is gracious and professional-the kind we should all expect but is hard to find. Unusual and artful presentations may begin with canapés arriving in a box of moss or along a branch. Follow this with hamachi served as a brilliant study of flavor and balance, showcasing silky and beautifully marbled fish, placed on a bed of coconut-infused rice pudding with dabs of black garlic, bits of finger lime, and lemongrass-spiced chutney. Genius and luxury are at play in the sinfully rich Australian Wagyu beef, served red and fleshy with classic Bordelaise, roasted maitake to magnify the umami, chunks of sweet lobster, and lobster foam to lend an ocean-like airiness to the plate.

To say there's a lot to choose from is an understatement, as there are nearly 100 rolled, crimped, steamed, and fried dim sum options alone. Highlights include flaky puff pastry turnovers filled with sweet and savory barbecue pork; and large lotus leaves that envelope tender sticky rice mixed with chicken, liver, and crab. When the dim sum parade ends at 4:00P.M., the menu shifts to an equally vast selection of Cantonese dishes like crunchy stir-fried lotus root with ginger.",Chinese,"2100 S.

Diners show up in droves for a rotating selection of steamed buns, crispy chicken bits, and slurpable noodle bowls. ""Logan Poser Ramen"" showcases Chef/owner Matthias Merges' house-made noodles, a swirl of thick, al dente strands in spicy tonkatsu broth.

Start with a choice from the large vermouth selection and a round of burrata with pickled mustard seeds and fresh mint, ready to be piled on lardo-brushed toast.

If you can tune out the diversions, the poster-sized menu of modern Italian antipasti, snacks, and family-style plates won't disappoint.

Sixteen,2.0,"This bold setting puts the Chicago River, Tribune and Wrigley buildings at your fingertips from the sixteenth floor of the Trump Hotel. The lobby entrance is as unremarkable as the dining room is dramatic, centered around an enormous Swarovski chandelier that hangs like an inverted wedding cake over a curving wall of African rosewood. Beyond this lies a kitchen that takes itself very seriously, but that's ok. Chef Thomas Lents' cuisine is extraordinary, accomplished, and even more of a draw than the décor. Meals here are very conceptual and include head-spinning affairs that articulate a theme, like the ""Faces of Sixteen"" as an homage to inspirations and employees. This may translate as a tribute to Joël Robuchon through a pot of wonderfully smooth, raw and seasoned langoustine artfully topped with gelée and sea buckthorn. Another theme ""Food in Progress, Modern Fine Dining: Moving Forward with Respect to the Past"" ponders the emergence of the Nordic through a gently smoked oyster, flavorful potato gelée, horseradish, and caraway.

Bartenders work just as hard as line cooks until the wee hours. The kitchen puts a highfalutin spin on simple bar eats. In-house butchers craft 32-ounce pork Porterhouses for sharing; foie gras for folding into fluffy scrambled eggs; and house-made sausages for bologna sandwiches that go well beyond a kid's wildest dreams.

From refreshing pieces of cold-poached chicken tossed with a generous mound of chili-oil and peanuts, to aromatic smoked tofu mingled with silky batons of celery stalk, flavors here often bring more complexity than straight heat and the presentations are more genteel than brute. But that's not to say the kitchen doesn't conduct a fiery arrangement-try crisp, meaty, and double cooked pork belly harmonized with hot Sichuan peppercorns, green bell peppers, leeks, and fermented black beans.

The fun and bling continues upstairs in the young, hip, and hopping lounge. Yet amid all this glitz and glam is a well-trained service team and very talented kitchen.

Tables receive a satisfying array of items like warm hand-pulled mozzarella, Neapolitan-style pizza, and zesty entrées like Mediterranean branzino with spicy puttanesca.

Sound like a beautiful dream? It is wonderfully real, and that's before they ply you with their excellent wine pairing, cocktails or tea tasting (yes, tea-trust us, you'll be talking about it for days). Chef Emborg's Danish-accented menu might begin with an exquisite chilled green tomato soup with juniper oil, before proceeding to a buttery waffle with savory mushroom cream and earthy black truffle. Then, tender snow crab in an ethereal tomato broth with rose hip cream; or sweet scallop with crisp green apple, dill fronds and horseradish ice may be tailed by springy sepia plated with tart currants and laced with a deadly delicious hazelnut fish cream.

Unlike many Japanese restaurants with one specialty, this izakaya's diverse menu includes bar snacks, sushi, steamed buns, and ramen. Tangy, spicy buffalo cauliflower is a playful take on wings, replacing chicken with bright orange chunks of deep-fried cauliflower tempered by cool, creamy ranch sauce.

Blanca's interior is sleek and minimal, with a pristine white counter lined with cognac leather stools positioned to watch the chefs create each dish.

Mexico and Brooklyn are in balance on a menu that includes small plates such as memelitas de frijoles, a masa disc topped with mashed black beans, spicy salsa verde, queso fresco, and crema.

Ada St.,0.0,"Despite its obscure location among the industrial warehouses of far-east Wicker Park, adventurous diners have no trouble seeking out Ada St. Reservations aren't accepted after 6:30 P.M., so the cozy, brick-walled lounge quickly becomes a party space where patrons peruse the wooden cubbies of vinyl to create their own soundtrack. The menu of small plates is influenced by both hearty gastropub dishes and lighter Mediterranean bites. Tabasco mash ketchup heats up a plate of charred, tender octopus, while a poached egg gilds rich duck confit tossed with cavatelli. Even the snappy green beans need nothing more than Dijon butter to shine.

Crispy battered fish is spiced up with sriracha-tartar sauce and chilled smoked cabbage slaw. Shredded roast pork is rubbed with adobo, glazed in tamarind, and joined with creamy avocado and queso fresco for tasty carnitas. Pickled red onions add punch to chunky guacamole.

Traditional Italian cuisine gets personalized tweaks from the chef. Carpacci may include paper-thin octopus, beets, or beef; macaroncini alla Briciola folds diced Tuscan sausage into a spicy garlic-sage sauce; and a hefty bone-in pork chop, pounded thin, breaded, and pan-fried until golden, is a house classic dressed with arugula and shaved parmesan.

EL Ideas,1.0,"Free your mind, keep your expectations high, and ignore the hand-made sign and desolate locale that make this undeniably edgy restaurant feel like a David Lynch movie. No one comes here for high-end pampering. Rather, the interior is an amalgam of heavy wood timber, zinc ductwork, abstract art, and a homespun curtain made of wine corks. The open kitchen and its team of freewheeling anti-heroes lend a dinner-party vibe, with guests bringing bottles of Bourbon as gifts for the chefs and others getting up to mingle. Woe to those who come here to dine alone. This prix-fixe is an all-embracive antithesis to highfalutin fine dining, with courses that the chef might describe as salty-sweet stoner food. Envision golden-fried potatoes in a piping hot leek soup, topped with liquid nitrogen-prepared vanilla ice cream that pops and crackles when poured overtop.

Long communal tables are ideal for groups lingering over small plates and a long list of gin-based cocktails. Nibbling should be the strategy here, starting with whole deviled eggs stuffed with tangy-sweet gribiche beneath a single crunchy fried oyster.

Simple, unpretentious food is the signature here, in dishes like insalata di carota, mixing sweet roasted carrots, peppery arugula, and pumpkin seeds-grab wedges of bread to soak up its citrusy vinaigrette.

Cómodo,0.0,"This charming, candlelit restaurant flaunts a Latin tilt while maintaining its very American, homey feel. Away from artsy SoHo this quiet slice of the neighborhood draws locals looking for an unfussy meal with bright flavors. The small space has exposed brick, two long communal tables, a semi-open kitchen, and carefully chosen music. Detail sets Cómodo apart, beginning with a thick, deep evergreen cilantro soup poured tableside, over a mound of fresh crab, smoky roasted poblano peppers, and tart goat cheese. The interesting and very approachable dishes go on to include lamb sliders on pão de queijo (Brazilian bread made with cheese and cassava) finished with a pop of chipotle cream.

Long wood tables line the room under a striking wall of boxes puzzle-pieced together to showcase collectibles like antique cameras. Shimmering subway tiles, an atmospheric soundtrack, and dim lighting lend a sultry feel. House-smoked whole wheat bread arrives with freshly churned ""chicken butter"" (that's butter with chicken fat) and maple syrup. A lamb belly and guajillo pepper roulade rests in goat-milk yogurt, topped with crushed almonds, pea tendrils, and paper-thin slices of radish. Confit fingerling potatoes are buried under an avalanche of porcini purée with smoky chorizo over the top.

Moti Mahal Delux,0.0,"This corner spot marks the first American location of a fine dining chain that began in Delhi and now boasts outposts throughout India. Here in NYC, Moti Mahal Delux offers two distinct seating areas: an earth-toned dining room and windowed sidewalk atrium. Their Northern dominated cuisine traces back to the kitchens of the Mughal Empire, which brought Muslim influences to the Indo subcontinent. Tasty tandoori preparations factor heavily, like anardana tikka-grilled white meat chicken infused with a pomegranate and black pepper marinade. Delightful flavors abound through the home-style mutton curry showcasing a brick-red sauce of spiced tomato, onion, and ginger; hot paratha dusted with dried mint; and mustard seed- and curry leaf-infused lemon rice.",Indian,"1149 First Ave., New York 10065",37.0,NY,4.2,58,2,50,0,0,37.0,10065

Shimmering gold accents pop against the room's brown leather seating, carved woodwork, and dark palette. Fans of Thai cuisine will enjoy the pleasantly pungent notes throughout the selection of salads and noodle dishes. Crunchy curried rice salad features deep-fried nuggets strewn with Thai sausage and lemongrass served with plenty of shallots, long beans, and lettuce, and a drizzle of Kaffir lime-mint vinaigrette. The kanom jeen features thin rice noodles soaked in a mildly spiced coconut-rich yellow curry that is generously stocked with huge lumps of crab meat, chopped pickled mustard greens, and caper berries.",Thai,"1122 First Ave., New York 10065",37.0,NY,4.1,16,2,101,0,0,37.0,10065
Andanada,1.0,"The ambience of this unselfconscious Spanish dynamo is vibrant and notably personable. Located just below street-level, Andanada is laid-back but still formal, with professional, customer-driven servers attending to your every whim. The crowd is lively yet sophisticated-whether seated at the date-friendly bar, pleasant glass atrium, or brick dining room decorated with memorable bullfighting scenes. Like its surrounds, this noteworthy cuisine arrives much more beautiful than expected-clearly there is modern talent in Chef Manuel Berganza's kitchen. While the chef's creative expression has been met with mixed results of late, each dish can at its best be composed with an eye on innovative cooking as well as classic flavors. Here, Catalan pork sausage is interestingly composed with shaved fennel and a fava bean casserole to elevate each bite. Then, pristine sardines are wrapped around pan con tomate and set over a bed of picada-style sauce for good flavor. Likewise, berenjenas asada is appealingly complex, served as cubed and puréed eggplant, balanced by a honey- and red wine-vinegar reduction. Simple-sounding mushroom croquettes combined with barely pickled mushrooms are gloriously earthy.",Spanish,"141 W. 69th St., New York 10023",62.0,NY,4.2,44,3,98,1,1,37.0,10023

Shingara, vegetable pakoras, and samosas are always available. This is in addition to a parade of daily specials: chandal, yellow lentils, is seasoned with garlic, ginger, and cumin; jumbo prawns or golda chingri are simmered in a thick sauce of spiced coconut milk; and gura mas, pan-fried small fish, swim in a tangy purée of greens and mustard oil.

Nightingale 9's home is the old Seersucker space, and the larger digs better accommodate the stream of neighborhood families out for something different. Its curious name refers to the old Brooklyn telephone exchange. Meanwhile, the ingredient-driven menu offers a subtle take on shredded green papaya salad that is accented by nuggets of house-dried beef, mint, and crispy shallots. Grilled beef meatballs are wonderfully chewy, flavorful, and fun in your mouth. They are in turn accompanied by sheets of rice paper and water; diners moisten these sheets until they become soft, pliable, and ready to roll with meat and herbs, before being dunked in spicy nuoc cham.",Vietnamese,"329 Smith St., Brooklyn 11231",37.0,NY,4.1,19,1,4,0,0,37.0,11231

Quality trumps quantity in the streamlined selection of product-driven creations. Silken strands of house-made fettucine twirled with lemon beurre blanc and finely grated parmesan make an enticing starter, while pan-seared skate garnished tableside with coconut milk broth redolent of lemongrass and Persian lime is an inspired entrée.

A recent unique offering featured a fiery broth infused with a blend of 12 spices and fish sauce and filled with bone-in pork rib, cabbage, and red chilies.

Inside, the theme continues with walls constructed out of flour sack-formed concrete blocks. For lunch, sandwiches on mouthwatering bread include grilled cheddar with roasted and pickled peppers on whole wheat pain au lait, or falafel-inspired broccoli fritters swaddled in a warm pita with shots of harissa and walnut-yogurt sauce.

The menu possesses whimsy and a wink, as in kosher (not really?) octopus with garlic purée and a white bean salad. The basbousa-crumbles of semolina cake with floss halva, creamy cardamom sauce, and date syrup-provides a decadent finish.

Amid sepia-toned photos and a flat-screen showing football (a religion here), find famished city folk ordering perfectly done proteins served with a thick and rich barbecue sauce. Rib tips and burnt ends are juicy, tender, and sumptuous when paired with tart, spicy kimchi.

That same sense of history pervades the entire space, which highlights plush banquettes, impressive ceramics, and glittering chandeliers. Was the striking tiled-floor inspired from a certain restaurant scene in The Godfather? Probably. Mid-century classics are what this menu is all about, but exalted ingredients, skill, and presentations will excite even the most cynical savant. Stylish servers-who work the floor with a little flirt and lot of flair-remain in character while presenting top antipasti like crusty garlic bread, soppressata, and fresh, particularly divine olive oil-dunked mozzarella. A Caesar salad tossed tableside with carb-worthy croutons and gently pickled white anchovies hits the ball out of the park, while pale-yellow, ricotta-filled tortellini over an intensely rich and meaty ragù is a laudable delight.

The cooking is nothing short of stellar, right from that Niçoise salad with thick slices of rare tuna, briny black olives, barely poached green beans, soft potatoes, and hard-boiled egg, to a local fillet of trout finished with mustard sauce and well-dressed frisée salad.

Their spot-on small plates are designed to be washed down by beer, sake, or distinctly Japanese cocktails like cassis with oolong tea or soda, or a Calpico sour.

The experienced service team, though, do a good job in ensuring the atmosphere never veers into the terminal seriousness that blights many a formal restaurant. When one surveys this luxurious backdrop and the impeccably manicured clientele, it is perhaps something of a surprise to find that the food is adventurous and creative. Chef Bryce Shuman and his kitchen team know all the latest cooking techniques and are not afraid to use them. Ravioli with smoked potato shows off their delicate touch but the grilled short rib demonstrates that they also know how to create layers of flavor. The menu comes in four sections and one is gently encouraged to have all four, although the hors d'oeuvres are meant more for sharing with a drink.

Service is incredibly hospitable; and whitewashed walls, raw timber, mortar-smeared brick, and modern Danish chairs fashion a farmhouse-chic interior that's as head-turning as the willowy young locals. To whet their thirst, wine bottles topping a wall-length table in the back dining room are presented and poured with panache. Chef Matt Lambert's forte is the modern cuisine of New Zealand with a contemporary twist. While he may be a Kiwi ambassador, Chef Lambert uses his understanding of very particular ingredients to craft dishes that are seasonal, delicious, and sometimes wildly creative. A rum-cured torchon of foie gras is at once dense yet melting upon contact, accompanied by sweet dates, tart green apple gel, and buttery brioche. Provenance is clearly a high priority in the exceptional Ora king salmon; the bright and supple tranche is topped with freeze-dried Satsuma, citrus oil, and herbs to complement its delicate flavor. For dessert, the superb carrot cake pulls together a spectrum of textures and tastes.

Refined techniques and top ingredients combine to produce a blend of homegrown-haute cuisine that's presented with exceptional service here. Laab neuh gae sets hand-chopped lamb ablaze with chilies, lime, and mint, whereas tender snails doused in a gently spiced green curry reveal a deep knowledge of nuanced savors. Funky flavors reach full bloom in gaeng som muu krob, crisp pork belly floating in a tart tamarind curry of sausage-stuffed squid, perfectly foiled by sweet lychees. And for a brazen show of taste and texture, tuck into the crispy duck leg (pet palo), served in a soy-anise broth with caramelized tangerine and a soft-cooked egg. Dessert highlights include a coconut sundae accentuated by salty peanuts.

A mix of distressed brick walls and sleek tiles fill the dining room, while brass mermaid door handles give the look a playful edge. Art deco-inspired fixtures hang over the inviting bar. Tasso ham lends a smoky hint of the South to chewy mounds of hand-rolled linguini and tender coins of braised octopus tossed with a chunky puttanesca sauce of tomato, olives, capers, and garlic. Silky, organic chicken liver mousse is served alongside a stack of toasted baguette slices and fennel-apple salad.

Add to that a familial staff and fantastic food...et voilà...a fun, energetic, instant favorite! There is a reason why each newcomer becomes a regular: the food is surprisingly delicious and very authentic.

Composed of a front bar area and larger, brighter dining room, the entire space is brought together with marvelous Persian rugs and exotic pierced-metal sconces. Nargis hits a strong stride among the locals for its convivial vibe and unique repertoire of dishes that may include a bojon salad of smoky eggplant tossed with garlic, peppers, carrots, and cucumber. Kebabs are taken seriously here, so try the succulent lamb with chopped onion and dill. Uzbek plov studded with chickpeas, lamb, and raisins is simple but imperative.

Like the menu, the beverage listing is loads of fun.

You really can't miss on bún-ker's menu, a whirlwind of Vietnamese dishes sporting a California-like freshness.

Settle into an array of pikilia; cold appetizers such as melitzansalata, eggplant whipped with herbs and olive oil. Chargrilled fish, priced by the pound, has a delightfully smoky essence and moist flesh. Whole smelts are a rare and traditional treat, simply pan-fried with a lemony herb dressing.

Dinner might begin with the traditional zensai, or appetizer plate of cold bites; and then move on to dishes like a warm, excellent chawan mushi topped with Florida golden crab, truffle dashi, and confetti of chopped chives. A plate of superbly fresh and seasonal sashimi, some of it expertly cured or carrying a drop of delicious sauce, may be tailed by a mind-blowing parade of bright sushi that might include hiramasa, king mackerel, Japanese ocean trout, Flying fish, sea perch, or the creamiest ebi you've ever tasted, carrying a whisper of shiso and Japanese uni.",Japanese,"30 Hudson St., New York 10013",112.5,NY,4.8,21,4,55,1,2,112.5,10013

From there, things just take off: along with the clever, urbane menu, an upbeat service staff, and thoughtful wine list brimming with sweet Puglian reds and organic Catalonians, the kitchen delights long before Chef/co-owner Ryan Hardy's renowned pastas hit your plate.

To that end, Estela's irreverent chef turns out focused, decidedly creative, and (very) small plates. Grilled bread laden with mussels and a tangy aïoli turns into a dazzling bite when paired with pickled carrots, just as beef tartare tossed in chili oil is smartly teamed with sunchoke crisps for sweet and savory hints.

This local favorite offers a stylish Little Neck-by-way-of-Tuscany setting for enjoying thoughtfully crafted classics with top-notch ingredients. A seasoned staff guides patrons through the many menu temptations. The kitchen dutifully honors Italian-American staples with skill. The pizza oven is a beauty, churning out perfect pies, while tables pile up with salads of fennel, red radicchio, pitted olives, and orange, as well as pastas like house-made spinach fettuccine with peas, cream, mushrooms, and parmesan.

Bay Area food enthusiasts might recognize Chef/owner Henry Trieu from his days cooking at the popular Slanted Door; here at Falansai, a pretty little nook that feels miles from the gritty streets surrounding it, Trieu elevates the already complex Vietnamese cuisine to the next level. The results will knock your socks off-honestly, you might never look at a bánh mì the same way again.

For a hot second, you might feel like you're the only one in the know about this secret lair, until the hip diners rubbing elbows at every table disabuse you of this notion. But really, once you get past the silly bouncer, you will never want to leave this den. And although you'll pay a handsome price for small portions here, when each bite sings with this much freshness and flavor, who's counting? Kick things off with anything from the amazing raw bar, where you'll find wildly fresh goodies like creamy oysters bursting with briny flavor. Then move on to delicate, salty trout roe laced with truffle honey and set over a thick slice of buttery toast; otherworldly uni toast, perfectly sweet and laid over malty pretzel with mustard oil and chopped chives; or melt-in-your-mouth Chianina beef carpaccio with luxurious Santa Barbara uni and caviar.

Luksus at Tørst,1.0,"Enter through Tørst, wander to the back, and find Luksus-it's like unearthing a little boudoir behind a beer bar. The small, highly Instagrammable room has a Scandinavia-via-Brooklyn look, with a choice marble dining counter for chef viewing and a smattering of tables. Sure, the crowd is heavily tattooed and tight-shirted, but this is no place for poseurs. Luksus has an artsy edge that cements Greenpoint's status as the current hotbed of NY cool. Cue the Girls location scouts. The young staff may be hipsters, but everyone is passionate, friendly, and can recite beer history like it's their catechism. Absolutely go for the pairing. The cuisine is firmly rooted in Scandinavian techniques and ingredients, with inspiration from afar and unfussy flashes of tinkered modernism. Simple staples add drama through spears of crusty sourdough with mouthwatering salty cultured butter. This may lead to barely smoked bluefish set over sunchoke salad, finished tableside in warm broth. Humble palate cleansers more than serve a purpose in the tart, tangy sea buckthorn sorbet with carrot sauce.

The menu may be hell for vegans, but it's a pork lover's paradise: cuts from every part of the animal find their way into nearly each dish, from hearty ham-stuffed burgers to the signature bacon-wrapped jalapeño poppers. Gently charred slabs of ribs basted with the Piggery's own heady barbecue sauce are teeth-sinkingly tender.

Sample Hakkasan's mouthwatering Cantonese eats, however, and you'll see that its appeal transcends the décor. The menu's extensive array of artfully plated treats includes hits like braised chicken dressed with soy sauce, toasted sesame oil, ginger, and scallions.

A serene, plant-lined interior courtyard leads to an airy dining room with a dark red horseshoe bar and prints of the owners' hometown, São Jorge, in the Azores.

An antipasto like roasted and chilled spicy-sweet cherry peppers stuffed with tuna salad or burrata with grilled bread are great for savoring with a Negroni or black-walnut Manhattan.

You might even see her refilling your water glass; this is a humble place where dedication trumps attitude. The nightly 17-course menu is a clear treatise on local, organic, and foraged cuisine. Don't be surprised to find bear jerky showcased in the deliciously inventive ""rock course"" that is literally served on a jet-black rock, along with a sticky bite of wild puffed rice mixed with mushroom marshmallow, and topped with Wisconsin cheddar as well as a vibrant pink peppercorn.

Because the food is very good. The lunch menu doesn't really get past lobster rolls and chicken legs, but at night the kitchen's innate skill is very much in evidence.

Trying to keep track of the ingredients of each dish will nullify the benefit of the wine, so instead just marvel at the clever presentation and dig in-because taste is what this food is all about. The dishes are intricate and elaborately constructed, with herbs playing an integral part rather than merely being a garnish. Occasionally your taste buds will get a little slap, perhaps with the odd Thai or Vietnamese flavor, and the courses will fly by. This style of cooking is very labor-intensive and if you want to learn more, then take advantage of their offer of a post-prandial kitchen tour.",Contemporary,"652 W.

The handsome dining room is a rustic-chic and masculine display of cowhides, distressed wood, and stone, with huge windows overlooking the Embarcadero. All this makes the crowded Pier 5 restaurant a highly coveted reservation. The Spanish fare has some California lightness (order extra). Begin with oblong, crunchy fried and chicharrón-encrusted chicken croquetas filled with English pea mousse. Toasted sandwiches of smoked salmon with queso fresco and truffle honey are tasty little bites.

Watch out-it rings with spice and packs a punch. Callaloo, ackee, chow chow, and giromon may not be words in the average foodie's vernacular, but Chef Kirnon presents them here, as part of a pleasing roster of dishes like phulourie-crisp garam masala-tinged split-pea fritters served with shado beni or tamarind chutney-washed down with sorrel, a sweet hibiscus punch.

One fact is evident, though: the crowd here has ritzy tastes, often flocking in from the high-end cigar shop next door and Bentley dealership down the street. Upscale American bistro cuisine is the focus with dishes like seared pepper-crusted ahi tuna, a veal rib chop with creamy Tuscan white beans, and meatloaf with potatoes and wild mushroom gravy.

Generous portions of great food including a creamy crab dip crusted with parmesan and studded with baby artichokes plays into the Southern bent.

Caraway seeds spice up duck meatballs nestled among springy egg noodles with dehydrated sauerkraut and shaved salted egg yolk, and honeycomb tripe wins new fans when fried to a crisp and topped with house-made giardiniera.

Brindille's menu isn't a sequel to NAHA's contemporary Mediterranean fare, but instead bears a strong Parisian accent influenced by the chef's love of French cuisine. Roasted chestnuts are whirled into a creamy soup and poured over compressed apple, wild mushrooms, and puffed rice.

Various bars offer pizza, crudo, fresh mozzarella, and house-made pasta, though even globally influenced dishes have a Mediterranean touch. The Tavern burger accompanied by parmesan-dusted fries is stacked with melted Taleggio, crispy speck, and garlic aïoli.

His family may own several other restaurants, but sizeable portions of house-made pasta with updated embellishments (think: montasio cheese topping a decadent ragù of veal and pork) highlight balance and excellence.

Beets take a turn in the rotisserie oven and arrive for your pleasure as a warm salad with hearty bulgur, pickled cucumber, and a pool of horseradish cream.

I Sodi,0.0,"Manhattan has classic Italian and new Italian, but not many thoughtful Italian restaurants. Tuscan native Rita Sodi is out to change that with this trattoria. She consciously selected every aspect of the design, from the heavy linen napkins to the thick, striated glass windows that hide the modern space from the marauding groups of young people on Bleecker. Inside this oasis, Negronis prep palates for al dente rigatoni and hearty, meat-focused dishes like the coniglio in porchetta. This exceptional rabbit preparation combines bacon-wrapped loin with a sweet wine- rosemary- and garlic-sauce. The herbal quality of such savoriness brings out the almost austere nature of the lean rabbit, showing how truly intuitive and innovative Italian cooking can be.",Italian,"105 Christopher St., New York 10014",37.0,NY,4.6,50,3,54,0,0,37.0,10014
Piora,1.0,"The West Village's impossibly quaint charm gets even more charming with an elegant dinner for two at beautiful Piora. The setting is polished, upscale and cozy, with a marble bar up front teeming with well-heeled beauties sipping cocktails; and a sleek white dining room in the back, featuring a stunning wall of glass overlooking a lush urban garden. It's a soothing experience from the start, a chance to sit back and sink into a perfectly prepared drink (don't miss the creative libations) and let the hustle of the city slough off as you consider the neighborhood's manicured charms. The polished staff together with elegantly prepared and very contemporary cuisine-carefully presented and borrowing from the many influences of Piora's Korean-born owner and Italian-American chef-only seal the deal. Take the perfectly al dente rigatoni, plated with savory crumbles of ground lamb-and-pork sausage and laced with dollops of bright green nettle pesto, jalapeño slivers, and shaved pecorino; or a beautifully prepared Four Story Hill Farm poularde, rendered to juicy, crispy perfection, and garnished with tawny sweet potato, pickled mustard seeds, tender Brussels sprouts, and foie gras foam.",Contemporary,"430 Hudson St., New York 10014",62.0,NY,4.7,33,3,2,1,1,37.0,10014
Sushi Nakazawa,0.0,"This is a typical NY destination, right down to the tough reservation. The calm setting contrasts the buzz surrounding Chef Daisuke Nakazawa. That hype means the place operates at its own pace; and your meal depends on where you sit-the counter offers fresh, meticulously prepared sushi and engaging chefs, while the dining room is steerage with apathetic servers doling out mediocre pieces of sushi all at once. But, this kitchen is stocked with the best of America's waters. Uni from Maine is beautifully prepared and notable thanks to hay-smoked bonito. Then, expect a live scallop, pearly and sweet, with just a hint of yuzu pepper paste. And, that Florida tiger prawn could not be more fresh or enjoyable as it is knifed and shelled.

This eye-catching space emanates a warm glow, enticing Lenox Avenue passersby to step in for a drink, snack, and much more. The bar area's communal table is a convivial perch, in addition to the quieter seating in back. Throughout, whitewashed walls attractively double as wine storage.

Neon signage out front marks The Cecil's entrance and the lounge's provocative artwork gets things off to a sexy start once diners step inside. Dinner here is a trip around the globe, guided by a menu that spotlights Africa, Asia, South America, and the US South. Skillet-fried salmon, dusted with cornmeal for a satisfying crunch, comes plated atop spicy kimchi-inspired slaw; and the feijoada is a stoneware pot full of black beans, braised oxtail, and merguez garnished with slivered collard greens and orange segments.

Created by design firm Yabu Pushelberg, the posh setting includes a series of rooms, each with their own striking touches that sprawl from a thickly carpeted staircase off the lobby. Worth a mention is the book room, with its stacks of bound-linen rag paper, mauve fabrics, and fresh flowers in mercury glasses. So too is the kitchen, whose talented team sends out ambitious preparations like the locally sourced scallop composition pairing carpaccio zested by pink grapefruit and yuzu with seared specimens swiped by sunchoke foam.

The cozy space is on the ground floor of a brownstone, so the setting is understandably narrow. East Pole's front bar is hopping, while black leather booths in the back allow parties to sit and enjoy an eclectic menu in relative peace. The stimulating cooking here begins with a salad of roasted heirloom carrots with hijiki, diced avocado, and an Asian-inspired soy-and-sesame oil vinaigrette. Then move on to explore Kiev-style chicken, stuffed with garlic butter-enriched broccoli purée, or creamy fish pie stocked with cod, lobster, and fennel.

Amid a robust culinary scene, Aita finds a niche with its warm (never effusive) service and equally comforting décor of antique mirrors, wood paneling, and lacy curtains. Chef/co-owner Roberto Aita certainly has a way with pasta, crafting thick, homemade noodles twirled with flavorful sauces, such as the taglierini with buttery clam broth that is slightly sweet with melted leeks and strewn with irresistibly briny littlenecks. Italian tradition echoes through beguilingly simple desserts, like a bowl of plump fresh berries with nothing more than a dollop of cream and end-of-meal biscotti.

Sweet watermelon aguachile is boldly dressed with fresh lime juice, spicy green chiles, blistered shisito peppers and hit of feta; while house-made links of merguez are nestled in a thick and creamy chickpea purée dotted with plumped golden raisins and accompanied by perfectly puffy wedges of hot pita.

M. Wells Steakhouse,1.0,"At this ultra-hip gastropub in Long Island City, first impressions can be wildly deceiving. At first, you'll wonder if you got the right address: from the outside, M. Wells Steakhouse looks like the old auto body garage it's housed in, but step inside and wow-the interior is all gloss and swagger, from its gold-and-black wallpapered ceiling and dripping crystal chandeliers, to its sexy red walls, stunning bar area, and open, wood-burning kitchen. Service is friendly and just as polished and charming as the design; though mercifully more earnest than hip. They seem refreshingly invested in your experience, dropping dishes with explanations; checking in regularly; and genuinely thanking you for your patronage. Don't miss the opportunity to drill them on wine pairing ideas. Their answers are thoughtful and spot-on. M. Wells may bill itself as a steakhouse, but the excellent raw bar, fresh fish entrées, and unique appetizers are up for some serious best supporting nods. Don't miss the bone marrow onion soup, a rich, delicious take on the French classic; rabbit terrine studded with candied fruit, truffle, and served en croute; and decadent Paris-Brest, a crispy pastry piped with hazelnut cream.",Gastropub,"43-15 Crescent St., Long Island City 11101",112.5,NY,4.3,42,3,99,1,1,62.0,11101

Co-chef and owner Erwin Schrottner (who hails from outside Graz) keeps everything authentic, from house-made bratwurst platters to the mustard sour cream. The pretzels arrive straight from Europe as divine carbo-bombs served with liptauer cheese and butter.

An experimental spirit is clear from the first bite of a warm poppy- and sesame seed-loaf brushed with pork fat and served with sweet-cream butter. Mackerel arrives with blistered skin, tender peas, favas, and charred Padron peppers. Superlative desserts show glimmers of genius, as in the loosely whipped cloud of sunchoke purée with warm toffee caramel and icy apple granita.

The Chinese-influenced menu cleverly mines its home continent for deliciously exotic accents, but the ambitious dishes can be hit or miss. Surefire items include the springy egg noodles tossed with tender chopped clams, then laced with scallions, ginger, garlic, and chili oil; or fresh, perfectly-cooked sea bream served with fennel, tangerine peel, chili oil, and fermented black beans.",Asian,"22 Orchard St., New York 10002",37.0,NY,4.6,26,2,29,0,0,37.0,10002

The prix-fixe is a true deal in this neighborhood, especially with choices from the raw bar and charcuterie. For heartier fare, try the country pâté or rabbit terrine, both classically prepared and perfectly seasoned. Silky beef short ribs are deeply comforting, garnished with bacon, mushroom, cipollini, and just the right amount of brawny sauce.

The menu is focused, the space is enormous, the air is clean, and the service is friendly. Start your grill off with steamed egg, corn, cheese, and more to cook along the sides while marbled pork belly or deeply flavorful marinated skirt steak strips sizzle at the center.

Cagen,1.0,"Boasting soothing textured walls the color of sand, sturdy but comfortable furnishings, and cool slate flooring, thisserene and serious space is just what one would expect of a high-end Japanese dining room. But, beyond this quotidian look is a kitchen that turns out very exciting-and quite unexpected-food. Tables are an available option, but a seat facing Chef Toshio Tomita at the pristine elm counteris the place to be. While the menu offers both à la carte dining and a sushionly omakase, the Chef's Counter omakase is by far the best experience to be had here. This meal begins with a playful platter of bites (envision smoked ham katsu) to break the ice and stimulate the palate for the kitchen's sparkling sashimi. Slices of Hokkaido octopus, marinated bonito, and snapper are a treat, dressed not only with freshly ground wasabi root and top-notch soy sauce, but also the chef's signature chimichurri-a touch of fusion that signals his decade-plus years of working at Nobu. Another highlight is the chilled handmade soba served with spicy buckwheat sprouts and a divine dipping sauce.

There, contents from the large glass jars of nuts, dried red chilies, and spices are ground in a mortar and pestle to produce its eponymous dish-also referred to as the city's best green papaya salad(s). Order big here, as the portions aren't massive and the food is plain terrific. The kitchen is happy to kick things up a notch spice-wise, so be aggressive and request the hotter end of the spectrum for greater authenticity. The service staff here is both friendly and hospitable, so heed their advice and include in every meal an addictive skewer of Der's-style grilled sticky rice to go along with the likes of lip-smacking larb tod. Other highlights have included succulent deep-fried chicken thighs sprinkled with toasted garlic chips and accompanied by a pungent citrus-and-spice dipping sauce. Smoky-sweet moo ping kati sod-marinated, grilled, and coconut-glazed pork set over cool rice vermicelli-is gloriously succulent and particularly addictive.",Thai,"85 Ave A., New York 10009",37.0,NY,4.3,97,2,101,1,1,37.0,10009

Creamy anchovy dressing and meaty bacon join in the chef's take on this classic reinterpretation of a wedge salad. Risotto-style beluga lentils balance intense mushroom stock with a subtle hit of jalapeños.

The menu's ""other soup"" is a sly reference held over from Prohibition days; and diners still walk past the window-fronted meat locker where slabs of USDA Prime beef are dry-aged. Gallagher's fresh sparkle is exhibited by the display kitchen, set behind glass panes. The chefs here turn out contemporary-minded fare like hamachi crudo with a yuzu-jalapeño vinaigrette to go with choice cuts of meat grilled over hickory.

Can't decide? Our favorites saw it rolled with grilled sweet peppers hinting of anchovies and presented sliced over arugula; as well as diced and stuffed into a trio of golden-brown, crumb-coated arancini filled with sweet pea-studded creamy rice.

When you do find it you enter into a stylish, beautifully understated and meticulously laid out room that wouldn't look out of place in the pages of ""Wallpaper"" magazine. It's run with considerable charm by a discreet and very courteous Japanese team. A lack of headings makes the two-page menu a daunting document so, instead of trying to construct your own meal, you're better off letting the chefs decide by going for the balanced and seasonal dishes of the seven- or nine-course omakase. Two things will quickly become clear: the ingredients are exceptional and the technical skills of the chefs considerable. This is food that is as rewarding to eat as it is restorative; standouts will be the lingering flavor of Washu beef, perfectly grilled anago, and anything with uni or their homemade tofu. There are tables available but it's so much more satisfying to sit at the counter and engage with the chefs-this way, you may even find that there are a few more dishes in their repertoire than they advertise.",Japanese,"73 Thompson St., New York 10012",62.0,NY,4.7,13,3,55,1,1,62.0,10012

Delicate details like fresh, fragrant flowers, beautifully set tables, and cozy rattan chairs make for romantic environs-and though the tight space has a way of turning intimate whispers into public displays of affection, all will be forgiven after a bite or two of Chef Brad Steelman's solid-as-ever cuisine. Launch into plump wild shrimp smothered in creamy Hollandaise and served with crunchy white asparagus for added texture; or the perfectly crisped crab cake arranged with creamy uni, avocado, and a light herb salad. Pearly white halibut with roasted maitakes is a testament to the kitchen's focus on simplicity and supreme freshness, while a glistening rack of mint- and mustard seed-glazed lamb-charred on the outside with an evenly pink interior-exemplifies its artistry.

The results are, as you'd expect, delightful. In summer months, there's a small outdoor patio with a handful of seats overlooking the sidewalk. Inside the restaurant, you'll find a long, narrow dining space with exposed wood beams; bare wooden tables; and photographs on the walls depicting farm life. The overall effect is one of rustic, folksy ease-with a genuinely warm and knowledgeable service staff adding to the appeal. Diners are offered a rotating, four-course dinner at an excellent value, where a collection of seasonal, farm-fresh small plates kick off the meal, followed by a pasta course, choice of entrée, and, finally, the day's dessert.

Case in point: quail egg and creamy uni atop a tender artichoke on a plate dressed up with dots of oils and shellfish reduction.

Solo diners head to the counter for a view of the action-packed kitchen, while others look for a seat from which to admire that mural of manga cutouts. Find them launching into pickled daikon with XO sauce and sesame seeds for a 'lil crunch and whole 'lotta flavor.

A tomato-red awning highlights the two-floor space designed by Taavo Somer, which features whitewashed brick walls, tawny leather banquettes, and a communal table topped with terra-cotta pots of greenery. Bensonhurst-native Chef Sal Lamboglia uses first rate ingredients to produce two categories of toothsome strands and shapes. Traditional preparations bring the likes of bucatini with lamb all'Amatriciana; while seasonal inspiration includes fiore di carciofi, a coiled tube of artichoke cream, dressed with diced fatty bacon and pecorino.

The Eddy,0.0,"If this innovative arrival is any indication, Curry Row could become the city's newest restaurant strip. Headlined by Chef Brendan McHale, formerly of Jack's Oyster Bar, the wee bistro is defined by a serious bar and well-managed dining area. The Eddy's menu defies easy categorization and offers cleverly constructed cooking. Fried beef tendons are a puffed and crunchy snack dabbed with charred onion cream and sweet trout roe. Delicate ricotta gnocchi with toasted hazelnuts showcases spring's sweet peas and pickled ramps, while golden spotted tile fish is seared and plated with squid ink Hollandaise, saffron broth, rice beans, and braised artichokes.

Flinders Lane,0.0,"Two Melbourne natives bring Australian dining to the East Village with this whimsical bistro. Flinders Lane hosts a convivial set in a petite room that's trademark downtown, with its mix of industrial and rustic touches. A strong Asian accent is woven throughout the menu, which also hails inspiration from Australia's Greek and Italian immigrants. Moist seaweed combined with avocado, snake beans, and roasted red pepper is a pop of flavors, brightened by a soy sauce- and toasted sesame oil-dressing. Grilled naan with tandoori-style rabbit is especially tasty thanks to its marinade of spiced yogurt and quick-pickled green mango garnish.

This is the kind of place that honors authentic sips like kalimotxo (red wine and cola), vermut (Catalan for vermouth), and sherry, so don't expect to see pitchers of sangria being bandied about. The proper dining room in the back is where the highly recommended tasting menu is served. This reasonably priced prix-fixe stimulates with small bites like sardine conserva served on buttered crostini with shaved radish; and may be followed by softly scrambled eggs drizzled with ruby shrimp jus, or seared lamb loin with greenmarket produce and crushed black olives.

From the exposed brick walls and wood-lined banquettes to the backyard garden and Faema espresso machine, the rustic, honest restaurant feels comfortable enough to spread out pappardelle with veal cheek ragù and seasonal daily specials like watermelon gazpacho. A rich, sweet soup spiked with tomatoes, it bobs with lumps of crabmeat and cooling cucumber. The menu, though, leans more toward traditional Italian dishes. Dig into the braised rabbit meatballs, paired with shaved ricotta and tonnato-style aïoli, as well as garganelli bathed in a saffron brodetto and topped with peekytoe crab accompanied by bottarga.",Italian,"259 Bleecker St., New York 10014",37.0,NY,4.6,59,2,54,0,0,37.0,10014

Drew Nieporent's Bâtard restaurant is now firmly in situ and once again we have a talented chef making waves in TriBeCa. Chef Markus Glocker's cooking is very precise and his dishes look quite delicate on the plate. But like a good featherweight they pack more of a punch than you're expecting. You'll even notice his Austrian roots in evidence in some of the dishes, such as short rib and tafelspitz terrine, or the Granny Smith and sweetbread strudel. The room is comfortable and neat and the atmosphere grown-up yet animated. When it comes to service though, it appears that the restaurant has mistaken informality for indifference as it lacks coordination or direction. So you may need to remind yourself that you're here primarily for the food. But that food is very good indeed.",Contemporary,"239 West Broadway, New York 10013",62.0,NY,4.3,77,3,68,1,1,62.0,10013

Throw in romantic low lighting, brick-lined walls and a tony TriBeCa address-and you have quite the operation. The service can be a bit off-putting, which is a shame because Racines NY has an ace, even affordable, wine list that bears discussion and recommendations. As for the food, you'll pay for all that sexy ambience a little more than the cuisine currently merits-but certain dishes, like a rich chicken liver mousse served with grilled breads, make for an elegant bar snack. Paired with one of those excellent wines by the glass and a seat at that handsome bar, you have a recipe for a glam night on the town.",French,"94 Chambers St., New York 10013",112.5,NY,4.6,29,2,44,0,0,37.0,10013

Even the small room, polished and modern, is ideal for the city's well-traveled locals. Top service and table settings further elevate the dining experience here that begins with aloo chutney pulao or basmati rice scattered with silky potatoes and spiced peas. Couple it with nali ki nihari (perfectly pink lamb in a creamy cardamom-infused curry) or khaas chicken korma rich with nuts for a profound and regal repast.

And why not? The banter is lively and meals rewarding. Its menu is a Brazilian-esque expression of the owners of Cómodo in SoHo. Curiously named dishes like poblano pepper fettuccine stars pasta tossed with a spicy, satisfying ragù made from roasted poblanos, pecans, and ground beef.

The slender expanse of red brick and concrete is brightened by a neon squiggle suspended from the ceiling, red Shaker-style chairs, and a kitchen-fronting wall clad with encaustic cement tile. A tray of crostini, simmered tomato, and garlic cloves is served gratis, for a do-it-yourself pan con tomate to stimulate the palate for what's to come. Enjoy croquetes oozing goat cheese and served with apple compote; or shaved summer squash with ibérico ham, blueberries, and padrón pepper vinaigrette.

Lucky Luna,0.0,"There's no other restaurant around like Lucky Luna. Seriously. Their delicious menu is a hybrid of Taiwanese and Mexican cuisine. The pizzazz on the plate is served in a simple yet tidy assemblage of glossy black tables, and an ambitious beverage program makes the small bar a total draw. Mom's sweet-and-sour cucumber salad, flavored with ginger and garlic, is a bracing start for Peking duck confit bao spread with hoisin mayonnaise, garnished with crispy duck chicharrònes and duck fat popcorn dusted with Chinese five spice. Another hit: the taco of ""reverse"" carnitas is a pile of succulent pork shoulder that's been seared then braised in a broth of beer, oranges, and tomatoes, and finally topped with crunchy bits of radish and spicy pickles.",Fusion,"167 Nassau Ave., Brooklyn 11222",18.5,NY,3.8,19,1,66,0,0,18.5,11222
Meadowsweet,1.0,"One of Brooklyn's most beloved venues, this chill yet sophisticated destination is illuminated by a soaring glass-fronted façade, whitewashed brick walls, and reclaimed pine furnishings. While the original mosaic-tiled floors lend a stunning, old-timey accent that hearkens back to the building's former life as a printer's shop built in the late 19th century, Meadowsweet is clearly rooted in the present day thanks to Chef Polo Dobkin and his skilled team. Best described as enticingly familiar and temptingly novel Americana with whiffs of the Mediterranean woven throughout, the menu is a delight every time. Each composition is beautifully plated, as in a bowlful of egg-rich tajarin slicked with intoxicating black truffle butter and served with frilly bits of sautéed hen-of-the-woods mushrooms as well as a showering of grated parmesan. A meaty block of wild halibut is expertly seared, presented cracker-crisp skin side up, and adorned with morels, asparagus, and pea shoots-or whatever the season's finest produce happens to be.

Toss in wood tables, inviting counter seating, and dusky blue walls, and you have this enticing pub. Chef Neal Harden has put together a menu of suds-friendly food consisting of vegetarian snacks (think fried hop pickles with preserved lemon aïoli), and salads such as grilled romaine and Tuscan black kale with beluga lentils. Pickle Shack's lighter fare is rounded out by hearty, imaginative sandwiches crafted from local ingredients and purveyors.

But rest assured it comes from a place of love, because that beautiful piece of nigiri has already been brushed with soy sauce, sprinkled with yuzu and sea salt, or dabbed with yuzu kosho. In other words, it's fantastic as is. A handful of straightforward cooked items like free-range chicken teriyaki or tempura udon are great if the kids are in tow, but the real focus is sushi best enjoyed in an omakase that won't break the bank. Be sure to choose the option that includes sashimi and begin this repast with velvety slices of medium fatty tuna and sparkling sea bass, followed by a maki of mackerel, slivered cucumber and pickled ginger.",Japanese,"210 Seventh Ave., Brooklyn 11215",37.0,NY,4.7,52,2,55,0,0,37.0,11215

A large, airy space complete with an impressive cement dome oven, Houdini's whips up a small but selective menu of excellent pastas and unique pizzas with daily specials. The generous spirals of tagliatelle bathed in a meat ragù make for a very satisfying start. Sure, it's carb-heavy, but when in Rome-right?

With a retro décor that spans two floors and a business that's run like a machine, Hatsuhana is a go-to for corporate dining. Though the rave reviews came decades ago, their traditional Edomae sushi still holds its own. Fish is top quality, the army of chefs have solid knife skills, and rice is properly prepared. This reliability draws a host of regulars who develop relationships with the itamae.

The unorthodox rendition of steak tartare is composed of zesty Thai-spiced dressing and a swipe of buttery Marcona almond purée.

Clever takes on approachable dishes abound on the menu, from ""toad in the hole"" lasagna with a poached egg at dinner, to asparagus and duck confit hash at brunch. The creamy smoked salmon mousse, with bagel chips and crème fraîche, is rich and delicious.

Bright, colorfully decorated, and flooded with natural light, it's a casual space where diners order and pay at the counter, then sip drinks from glass Mason jars under the potted palms. The outstanding Baja fish tacos are the source of Cholita Linda's reputation, but its dishes traverse Latin America, from a hearty Cubano to a plate of slow-braised, well-seasoned carnitas with black beans and fried plantains.

Then, order a variety of their exquisite small plates for sharing. Every dish is a carefully crafted delight for the senses. Baby kale and mustard greens might not sound very Japanese, but they blend beautifully in a salad with Fuji apple and a sesame-miso dressing.

Sichuan influences abound, but chili-hounds beware: the cooking is more about flavor than fire.

Its location (a wood-framed 1916-era grocery) could pass as some John Wayne film set, but Ciccio is more of a spaghetti Western, thanks to the focused Italian-influenced menu featuring a mega-rich pasta accented with fresh uni, crisp breadcrumbs, and a generous dose of cream. Segue from carbs to the bone-in pork chop with fennel gratin, but don't miss the remarkable signature Ciccio sponge cake, soaked in citrus liqueur and topped with grapefruit and orange.

Arrive at dinner, sit at the counter, toss aside that à la carte menu, and opt for an omakase feast created by the very talented chefs. Expect them to take liberties and leave tradition behind; yet the quality remains high with pristine nigiri featuring fluke, scallop, or geoduck clam minimally garnished and perched atop rice with a touch of nutty red rice vinegar.

Of late, due to increased popularity (and ergo, demand), the nightly omakase tasting has felt more like a conveyor belt-style dining experience. However, by employing myriad cooking techniques, Chef Mitsunori Kusakabe ensures that every bite is deliciously balanced and memorable. After awakening the palate with a cup of warm kelp tea, embark on a sashimi parade starring thick slices of bluefin served over crushed ice and with a tangy yuzu- onion- and sesame oil-sauce. A soup course may feature fresh crabmeat in a delicate tai broth bobbing with mitsuba, tofu, and sweet corn-speckled fish cake. And finally, a top rendition of sushi yields shima aji with daikon as well as ayu that is torched just enough to blister the skin and impeccably contrasted with grated cucumber.

Maruya's increased flexibility extends to the menu as well, where traditional dishes like warm, house-made chawan mushi-style tofu or blanched asparagus gets punch from the addition of black truffle and blue cheese sauce, respectively.

The décor is unexceptional by no uncertain terms, but really nobody seems to care, as the cooking-punctuated by Californian elements and welcome seasonality-is the real deal. Northern Thai is what this kitchen is all about and pad Thai-loving palates should vacate these premises...pronto. Of course, the unique menu reads like a veritable thesis on Isaan food mingled with California love. Then there's the easygoing and chill staff who never miss a beat-as they bestow tables with vibrant, product-driven plates. These have included crispy lima beans tossed in nam tok followed by crunchy albeit not as ""hot"" chicken wings massaged with tamarind and chili. Pork meatballs seasoned with garlic and lemongrass (laab tod) are enriched by a phenomenal chili (jaew) sauce; while a gorgeous platter of crunchy vegetables is accompanied by a jar of the incredible nam prik (potent with shrimp paste) layered with caramelized pork jowl, fried catfish, and a salted duck egg. Panang curry with tender-braised duck is a champ among palates less valiant. Closing arguments may reveal that this is a truly Thai kitchen turning out insanely memorable food.

The food is authentic, with some modern touches like the green almonds in a trout amandine with Lyonnaise-style potato salad, or the bison in a tartare with a quail egg. Brunch is a highlight with a gourmet eggs Benedict over artisan levain and butter-basted asparagus that steals the show.

Begin with the pâté de Campagne, enhanced with liver and shallots and presented with strong mustard, cornichons, and country bread. The Arctic char amandine is excellent, dressed with fragrant beurre noisette and served over a bed of crispy haricot verts and sunchoke.

Though billed as Italian-inspired cooking, the kitchen takes liberties with traditional dishes on the seafood-heavy menu. Well-grilled and generously oiled sourdough fett'unta topped with combinations like baccalà and Dungeness crab are rustic introductions to the meal. Ask for more bread to soak up the Neapolitan-style ragù-a skillet bubbling with goodies like a swordfish meatball and slabs of grilled pork belly in a tomato gravy.",Italian,"1015 Rush St., Chicago 60611",62.0,IL,4.3,64,3,54,0,0,37.0,60611
Dusek's (Board &amp; Beer),1.0,"Dusek's brings the party to Pilsen thanks to its palpable energy, groovy beats, and good-looking bar pouring an exceptional beverage program. Then consider the fact that the owners of Longman & Eagle are behind this operation and know that you're in for some seriously unique and outstanding eats. Housed in a booming, hipster-centric corner of the lower west side, this stylish public hall has major cool factor and enough real estate to be a triple threat. Framed by windows, the dining room is on the main floor while the upstairs (Thalia Hall) is a live music venue. Service throughout is very cordial, so settle in and await a spread of quirky American food. The menu changes daily so don't get hung up on favorites. However, smash-hits may include a wood-roasted cheese-stuffed pretzel coupled with wasabi dipping sauce as well as an ultra-decadent blue crab dip paired with artichoke relish and crusty, house-made pain d'epi. Live out your gourmet gastropub fantasy with slow-cooked salmon sporting a salty crust and spiced with salsa verde; or gnocchi tossed with lamb Bolognese and creamy ricotta. Portions should necessitate a doggie bag, but all the better to save room for an inventive fruit loop donut or even roasted chili churros with dulce de leche.",Gastropub,"1227 W. 18th St., Chicago 60608",37.0,IL,4.4,116,3,10,1,1,37.0,60608
A10,0.0,"A10 is a highway that winds through the Italian Riviera, but its detour through Hyde Park comes courtesy of prolific restaurateur, Matthias Merges. University of Chicago students and staff populate this split space, building a buzz over marble-topped rounds in the low-key bar area or dark wood tables in the convivial dining room. Like the décor, the menu deftly balances comfort and sophistication. A single fresh pasta ribbon folded back and forth becomes lasagna filled with succulent veal osso bucco, fresh baby oregano leaves, and both quark and Parmigiano cheeses tucked within each layer. Tender chunks of octopus, Niçoise olives, and saffron-tinged slaw dress a chickpea fritter; and rustic chocolate beignets with toasted meringue triangles sweeten the finish.",Italian,"1462 E. 53rd St., Chicago 60615",37.0,IL,3.9,54,2,54,0,0,37.0,60615
42 Grams,2.0,"To know the name refers to the supposed weight of two souls is to also know that this is not your usual restaurant. In fact, it's hardly a restaurant at all and more like a dinner party with strangers-you even need to arrive with a bottle or two of wine under your arms. There are two sittings: the first is at the counter where you watch Chef/owner Jake Bickelhaupt and his two colleagues in action; for 8.30 P.M. arrivals, it's the large communal table. For both, you'll be sharing your dinner with people you don't know, but the ice is usually broken by someone asking where their fellow diners have eaten recently. The set menu offers no choice but any allergies are discussed during the bothersome flurry of e-mails that follow the initial impersonal booking process. Then it's over to Jake's smiling wife, Alexa, to guide diners through the parade of dishes. The cooking is clever and contemporary and the ingredients superlative, whether that's the peekytoe crab ""dumpling"" or mojama de atún (air-dried, salt-cured tuna) plated on black slate and perched above a light green pea gelato. Dishes are wonderfully well-balanced and modern techniques are used to great effect to deliver superb flavors.

Step past the vintage Toledo scales to arrive at this reclaimed wood-paneled space dressed with antique meat cleavers, quaint ceiling fans, and large barn doors. If that doesn't scream farm-to-fork cuisine, consider what's being whipped up in the open kitchen (the banquette across from it affords the best view): a ramp raviolo filled with ricotta, a perfectly cooked hen's egg, and enhanced by brown butter and shiitakes; or a halibut fillet with cherry tomatoes and asparagus.

The affordable lunch menu features dishes like carrot salad with shaved country ham, an assertively spicy togarashi dressing, and a swipe of yuzu curd; or udon in a thickened broth with diced tofu and seasonal vegetables.

Don't spoil your appetite by eating too many of the complimentary house-made black olive grissini before the entrées arrive.

Young foodies fill the space every night, whether seated at tables lining the wooden banquette or perched on colorful stools dotting a double-sided slab of counter, half of which faces the open kitchen. Clark and Kim's exemplary cuisine results from a deep understanding of the Korean pantry as well as a brilliant application of au courant technique to seasonal product. Baked potato bing bread, the restaurant's signature flaky flatbread carb-bomb, is stuffed with melted scallions and bacon bits, topped with nutty sesame, and served with sour cream butter. Then, cauliflower is deep-fried, set over cool, herbaceous raita, and studded with shards of spicy tandoori chicken skin; while dukbokki, or Korean rice cakes, are pan-crisped and combined with bits of succulent goat meat sausage and refreshingly bitter wilted rapini. Desserts are a stellar finish-think silky panna cotta served with a soy sauce-caramel drizzle and topped with popped corn, or a novel take on fruit crisp with buckwheat, Bing cherries, ginger-spiced broth, and scoop of sakura ice cream.",Fusion,"3500 N.

Though the space is new, it has an old soul: communal benches hearken back to the days of classic Bavarian biergartens, and the enormous Bohemian Export beer mural that commands guests' attention is indigenous to the building-a happy discovery during demolition. A stack of small plates on each table sends the message that everything on the menu is meant for sharing. A German onion pie arrives straight from the oven, topped with shaved asparagus and made-to-order Pilsner soubise.

It's the perfect choice for a summer's day-and not a bad one in the colder months, either if you're having a quick bite before the theater or want to shake off those winter blues for a while. There's even a countdown showing the number of days till summer. The menu proves a good fit for the surroundings by keeping things easy. There are sandwiches, tacos, and salads, but it's the meat and fish from the wood-fired oven that stand out. For dessert, choose a big cookie from the counter by the entrance.

The lights are turned down and the music is turned up-and unless they know Big Audio Dynamite, it's not music for kids. When it comes to the food, ""locally sourced and globally inspired"" is their USP with the chef, a Four Seasons alumnus, making much of his largely European peregrinations. Expect punchy flavors, teasing combinations, clever twists, and everything from salumi and tuna crudo in a jar to ""popcorn"" sweetbreads, pastas, and Moroccan stews.

On the second floor is the narrow and nominally named Deco Room where the marble-topped tables face another bar; and upstairs is reserved for private parties. The food is certainly more than a mere addendum to the terrific cocktail list and the kitchen is clearly a skilled one.

The tonkotsu ramen is a traditional pleasure afloat with sweet slices of chashu, wakame, and molten egg. Meanwhile, the smoked brisket ramen is a novel departure defined by a black garlic-enriched chicken broth and slices of Bub City's 18-hour brisket. Ramen-san's loyal following is comprised of hipsters and suits alike, and they all seem to dig the salvaged look and booming playlist.

You might even adopt a drawl while reading through Root & Bone's pleasing menu. Grandma Daisy's warm angel biscuits are incredibly light and fluffy-especially alongside that salty-sweet, dark chicken-maple jus for dipping.

The cuisine follows suit, with the globe-hopping chef serving up skilled dishes like a foie gras-stuffed pigeon pie in perfect pastry dressed with spiced jus and plated with a light version of the Waldorf salad.

Other delicious offerings include small plates such as wood-fired radicchio paired with blistered cherry tomatoes and luscious burrata, all given a drizzling of vin cotto, as well as exceptional pastas like penne slicked with a ricotta-enriched tomato sauce hit with pepperoncini and fresh mint.

Treviso spears are brushed with creamy Caesar dressing and plated with warm, buttery croutons, clementine segments, and toasted sunflower seeds. Black bass is expertly seared and sauced with New England-style clam chowder pocked with Chinese sausage and perfectly complemented by a side of banana leaf-wrapped sticky rice enriched with duck fat.

The husband-and-wife behind Faro have years of restaurant experience between them, so it's not surprising that this casual, dependable restaurant serves dishes carefully crafted from well-sourced ingredients. If the goal at Faro is comfort food with integrity, they more than succeed in this mission by pushing out dishes like sweet pea porridge studded with fresh morel mushrooms; and light, chewy gnocchi Sardi dotted with sweet ricotta, braised goat, artichokes, and tomatoes.

The menu's tempting seafood options include a dozen types of fresh, plump oysters; lobster mac and cheese studded with greens and bacon and served in a cast iron skillet; as well as mini lobster rolls with a citrusy remoulade.

Like Maialino, Marta is helmed by Chef Nick Anderer and boasts a Roman accent. But, that's where the similarities end. Crispy, thin-crust pizza is the main attraction on this pasta-free menu: the margherita, for instance, is a crackling delight from the pizze rosse listing, while the anatra combining duck confit, fennel, and golden raisins is a novel pizze bianche.",Italian,"29 E. 29th St., New York 10016",37.0,NY,4.3,117,2,82,0,0,37.0,10016

Kick things off with a grilled tomato salad, bursting with fresh herbs, salty feta and smoky shishito peppers.

Get things started with a selection of country toast, served with delicious spreads like one of smashed pea and fava bean with pecorino, tarragon vinaigrette, and pea leaves; or whipped lardo with crisp radish, caper salad, and parsley. For dinner, try the buttermilk-fried skate, served over a bed of cracked hominy with basil seeds and salsa verde.

So does the food hold up to the setting? Terrifically, for Chef Frosolone has a knack for sourcing ingredients and a memory for Sicilian flavors. Must-try dishes include near-perfect caponata with pignoli, vincotto, basil, and silky potato; sashimi-grade crudo di tonno with tart lime, zucchini ribbons, and caperberries; or busiate tossed with ruby-red shrimp, green zucchini, and pomodori di Pachino.",Italian,"60 Thompson St., New York 10012",62.0,NY,4.1,18,3,54,0,0,37.0,10012

Skewers and small plates of charred nibbles include sweet miso-glazed goma fu, fish collar of the day, or strips of boneless Kurobuta pork short rib.

Even the décor here at Blenheim reflects this philosophy by way of distressed wood paneling and a style that is far more country-cool than precious. Service is eager and just as committed to the chef's mission of presenting pure ingredients with progressive elegance. There may be no more genuine expression of this kitchen than the farm eggs, their yolk bright orange and fresh, set beside gently charred slices of hangar steak and fork-tender fingerlings. Silky foie gras torchon is finished tableside with refreshing tomato water; and dense, creamy quadrello di bufala with pistachio sable is a welcome stand-in for an arid bread pudding.",American,"283 W. 12th St., New York 10014",62.0,NY,4.2,22,2,2,0,0,37.0,10014

Crostini are deceptively simple and flavorful, such as chicken livers folded with caramelized onions and sage generously spread over grilled sourdough bread. Fried green olives, pitted and stuffed with pork sausage arrive piping-hot and pleasing. Thick ribbons of pappardelle are a satisfying, chewy base for a hearty wild boar ragù.

Antipasti include a luscious salad of shaved fennel and orange segments crowned by tender-grilled octopus drizzled with zesty salmoriglio sauce.

Could the delicious looking Italian menu be just as special? The answer is most delightedly yes. An appetizer of spiedini alla Romana arrives topped with a delicious lemon, anchovy, and caper sauce; while a generous bowl of rigatoni ripieni alla Sangiovese is stuffed with savory beef tenderloin tips that have been braised in Sangiovese.

Sprawled on a stretch of Richmond Road dotted with florists and bridal shops, Mario's offers big windows for people watching, leather banquettes, and oversized artwork. It's practically law in this borough to start your meal with calamari, and this respite doesn't disappoint-it's refreshingly light and served with a scrumptious, herby lemon sauce. Move on to a tender poached pear salad with crushed walnuts, creamy Gorgonzola, and crispy prosciutto; or fall-off-the-bone osso buco plated with a soft pile of saffron risotto.",Italian,"1657 Richmond Rd., Staten Island 10304",37.0,NY,4.0,49,2,71,0,0,37.0,10304
cocoron,0.0,"Don't mind the manga posters or the menu's colorful cartoons; this is a serious destination for all things soba. The room is cramped and the furniture flimsy, yet a seat at the counter facing the open kitchen promises excellent cold, warm, and dip soba noodles. Service underwhelms and the scene is quirky, but the focus here is solely on the noodles and noodles alone. Curry dip soba arrives as a shallow bamboo basket of firm, chilled noodles just as a heavily spiced sauce with pork, ginger, and green onion bubbles away in a clay pot set atop a small flame. Dunk these strands of cold soba into the hot broth and let the slurping begin. Then rest assured that when you're done, the curry is fortified with hot soba water to form a delicious and drinkable soup.",Japanese,"61 Delancey St., New York 10002",18.5,NY,4.5,68,2,55,0,0,37.0,10002
Louie and Chan,0.0,"With a name that nods to the convergence of Chinese and Italian immigrants in this part of lower Manhattan, Louie and Chan is a dimly lit, tightly packed restaurant with inspired cooking. The main space feels more bar than dining room, with intentionally scruffy walls decorated with distressed mirrors. Service is friendly and a young crowd keeps things lively. Cocktails are Asian-inspired while the menu uses Italy as its muse. Delicate gnudi arrive in a rustic bowl of tender lamb ragù topped with a dollop of smoked ricotta. A wood-burning oven is responsible for the blistered crust pizzas, including the bacio del diavolo, decked with tart tomato sauce, chunks of 'nduja, house-made mozzarella, and spicy whole Calabrese peppers.",Italian,"303 Broome St., New York 10002",37.0,NY,4.3,39,2,54,0,0,37.0,10002
Il Gattopardo,0.0,"This leopard's take on Italian dining favors elegance over rusticity. Set within two Beaux Arts townhouses (once home to a Rockefeller family member), the restaurant is an understated sprawl of ivory walls contrasting dark-stained floors and smoky mirrors. The smartly attired staff attends to a buttoned-up crowd digging into pricey but pleasing fare like shaved artichoke salad with organic frisée, lemon, olive oil, and bottarga di muggine. Here, veal scaloppini is a pounded filet layered with grilled eggplant and smoked provolone, alongside braised escarole studded with black olives. Like everything else at Il Gattopardo, the cassata Siciliana-with its candied fruit and bright green almond paste-is a dressed-up take on the classic.",Italian,"13 W. 54th St., New York 10019",62.0,NY,4.2,39,3,71,0,0,62.0,10019
Le Fond,0.0,"Chef-owner Jake Eberle's cute corner restaurant shows us that not every dish needs reimagining and not every recipe requires reinterpretation. He's a French-trained chef whose cooking is crisp, clean, and comfortingly classic-and his well-balanced menu includes words like ""roulade"" and ""blancmange"" that here seem curiously reassuring. That's not to say his food doesn't pack a punch: the rich, meaty cassoulet could keep an army on the march for days. Globe lights hang from the ceiling to illuminate a sea-blue room with bespoke wooden furniture. The acoustics can be bouncy and those lacking the necessary padding will find the seating a little numbing.

Anassa Taverna,0.0,"Two floors of whitewashed brick walls and large windows dressed with sheer drapery provide a respite for weary shoppers and a sociable clientele at this contemporary taverna. The upstairs dining room is sedate, but remains your best bet when crowds pack the ground-level bar area. Anassa's menu is an honest presentation of Greek specialties, including a platter of spreads, sushi-quality charcoal-broiled octopus, and a selection of Mediterranean and North Atlantic fish to be grilled and dressed with extra virgin olive oil, fresh lemon, and capers. Nightly specials add further variety to the extensive menu.

Inside, tables loaded with vibrant dishes flaunting heightened levels of fire are bound to tingle palates and tempt passersby. Kao soy, the famous curry from Chiang Mai, is a signature for fitting reason. Topped with crispy egg noodles, this combo unites dark meat chicken, egg noodles, crushed peanut, and lime. A tart green mango salad mingled with crispy anchovies and sweet cashew nuts is a delight on its own; while banana blossom fritters should be dunked in thick peanut-chili sauce for more flavor.

Semilla,1.0,"Vegetables bask in the spotlight at this stellar South Williamsburg counter, where the formidable team of Chefs José Ramírez-Ruiz and Pamela Yung apply their fine dining aptitude to produce an improvisational feast out of the season's bounty. Turning the notion of service on its head, members of the kitchen step away from their stations to deliver their intricate compositions-each of them plated on hand thrown pottery. The briefest of descriptions is offered upon presentation, which means that a mouthful of ""grilled squash,"" for example, might also deliver raw slivers of pattypan, creamy peanut sauce, and a dusting of dried mint. Embellishments like foie gras and trout roe are used sparingly and to splendid effect, never outshining the true flavor of the produce. Semilla's bread is house-made, excellent, and used to accentuate the menu; as seen in a wedge of flax seed-barley sourdough with cultured butter to accompany a roasted carrot ""mille-feuille,"" alongside smoked potato purée and fava-greens sauce. Although the duo of sweets to finish may include options that disappoint, dessert can also be an electrifying success as in the egg yolk-saffron sorbet, cloud of smoked cream, and passion fruit.",Contemporary,"160 Havemeyer St., No. 5, Brooklyn 11211",62.0,NY,4.5,24,4,2,1,1,112.5,11211

The menu features such delights as lamb shank braised with Armagnac and prunes, delicious char-grilled meats, and many meze. Of course, every meal here begins with fresh, piping hot pita. Hot, tender, and brushed with olive oil, the bread is sprinkled with the namesake spice blend along with a hearty dollop of labne. Pair it with an appetizer of batin jan makdous, pickled baby eggplants stuffed with garlic-walnut paste, then move on to the kafta kebab.

A list of specially selected oysters from the raw bar-like kumamotos from Washington State dressed with wasabi leaf and lemon-or zucchini carpaccio with feta and toasted pistachios prelude Bowery Meat Company's red-blooded roster. This may reveal a bone-in filet mignon au poivre, dry-aged NY strip, and grilled pork ribeye with Korean barbecue sauce.

Headed by a trio of Per Se veterans, Noreetuh features an intimate setting of two slender dining rooms adorned with hexagonal mirrors and shelving units used to store bottles from the impressive wine list. Bigeye tuna poke strewn with seaweed, diced macadamia nuts, and pickled jalapeños is just one of the delicious highlights on offer, while plump shrimp seasoned with crushed garlic and arranged over a bed of sticky rice and baby romaine is another fine choice.

White tiled walls, amazing artwork, and lovely fresh flowers ensure that the well-designed dining room feels cheery and comfortable. Generous space between tables promises privacy. Local and seasonal ingredients dictate the menu, especially in the raw and cured section-Long Island fluke or Peconic Bay scallops are simple, fresh opening acts. Purple and orange carrots are roasted until tender, topped in crisp breadcrumbs, then beautifully plated with a tangy black garlic aïoli. A burgundy-hued beetroot risotto is studded with goat cheese.

Fill your table with a dumpling feast, stuffed chock-full of duck and mushroom, spicy-sour squash, or lamb and celery redolent of lemongrass and spices. Larger dishes are equally memorable; those cold, thick, slurp-inducing green bean noodles soaked in heady, tart black vinegar with raw white sesame seeds, cilantro, cucumbers, and wood-ear mushrooms will have you coming back for more...and then some more.",Chinese,"42-35 Main St., Flushing 11355",18.5,NY,4.2,31,1,37,0,0,18.5,11355

This being the East Village, the dining room is chic but low-key with a pale earthy color scheme framing a communal table and metal chairs. As for the menu, the restaurant's name says it all: the bao is absolute perfection. Presented in a bamboo steamer with soy and vinegar dipping sauce, each parcel is artfully dimpled, delightfully toothsome, and plumped with tasty broth and seasoned meat. Save room for sampling some of their other delicious specialties, including julienned celery stalks stir-fried with dried tofu; diced chives tossed with ground pork and fermented black beans; or XO sauce-fried rice.",Chinese,"13 St. Marks Pl., New York 10003",37.0,NY,4.3,107,1,29,0,0,18.5,10003

Find Spanish cheeses and charcuteria of Iberico pork, but the true star here are the conservas. To refer to these as canned seafood would be technically correct but improper- digging into a few is obligatory. Among the temptations, expect a delicate miniature tartalata filled with smooth sea urchin and toothsome octopus.

The Melotti family produces rice in Veneto and this stateside location is sister to Isola della Scala in Verona. Scenes from the film Riso Amaro on a mounted television add atmosphere to the rustic surrounds, where the air is filled with the sounds of stirring as each order is prepared. A bread basket stuffed with rice cakes precedes plates of risotto limone e gamberi made with lemon juice and studded with morsels of pan-seared shrimp. More complex risotti may be presented in a crispy Monte Veronese cheese cup and showcase Amarone wine.

Fine stemware and items presented on wooden boards lend an upscale manner to the experience. Chef Christian Ramos takes risks while building upon a steady foundation from time spent as a sous chef at Per Se. A crostini of fava bean tapenade and shredded squash is a bright summertime treat-best paired with an icy glass of rosé. Pan-seared striped bass with new potato wedges is sauced with saffron-infused cockle broth; and the black-and-white sablé arranged with a taste of cocoa nib mousse and candied pistachios offers a sweet finish.",Contemporary,"647 E. 11 St., New York 10009",37.0,NY,4.6,19,3,2,0,0,37.0,10009

Witness peas done three ways-mashed, julienned, sliced in their pods, and plated with creamy ricotta, pea broth, and mini parathas; or a glossy, slow-cooked egg served over salty broccolini and shredded Brussels sprouts with a lemony sorrel Hollandaise.

It's possible to feast on starters alone like ladolemono-dressed grilled octopus with fava bean purée, or papoutsakia (stuffed eggplant topped with caramelized béchamel sauce).

A sushi tasting and sushi kaiseki are the only options offered yet diners will not be left wanting. While the latter is a fuller experience working in an abundance of flavors like pan-seared squab breast, the tasting is a slightly streamlined and more rewarding choice.

Tables are a comfortable seating option, but the best place to be is at the counter.

Chef de cuisine Mariana Villegas oversees the execution with an eagle eye: a silky scallop aguachile is fanned out and topped with cool, poached jicama, serrano chiles, and fresh wasabi root; while a tender eggplant tamal arrives smoky-sweet and topped with house-made ricotta and a bright green herb sauce.

Yuzu's personable staff lends an amiable tone to the vibe. Chef Tomoyuki Hayashi has worked at the venerable Sushi Azabu, so expect to be pleased from start to finish.

Cheerful waiters, clearly invested in the evening's menu, meander from table to table, discussing the food and dropping dishes like a ripe stone fruit and prosciutto salad with salted honey Cloumage cheese; or a tower of savory fried green tomatoes laced with buttermilk dressing; or moist meatloaf tucked into a soft roll and dressed with fresh cabbage, pickles, and barbecue sauce.",American,"397 Tompkins Ave., Brooklyn 11216",37.0,NY,4.6,31,2,2,0,0,37.0,11216

Chef Gabriel Kreuther's Alsatian heritage provides a distinctive mark here, evinced by the stork imagery throughout and by his exciting cuisine espousing regional pride. His elegantly composed sturgeon and sauerkraut tart is a delightful signature creation adorned with American caviar and infused with smoke. Frilly cones of nori-enriched pasta are presented with meaty slices of Alaskan king crab and parsnip purée; while lusciously tender Maine lobster poached in Mangalitsa lardo is dressed with jamón emulsion.

Rebelle has an edgy vibe-the space was once a burlesque bar, after all. But, beneath that veneer is impressive talent delivered with a sexy French accent. While Chef Daniel Eddy's streamlined presentations and foam flourishes have contemporary flair, rest assured that classic technique is at the root of every dish. Lamb tartare is perfectly balanced, boasting piment d'Espelette-kissed cubes of meat tossed with green chickpeas, strained yogurt, and a slice of excellent toasted bread. Then, exceptionally tender pork loin is served over a mustard-tinged sauce with wilted greens, grilled spring onions, and a delicious bite of deep-fried headcheese.

Upland positively glows from its burnished wood furnishings, glossy cream-colored walls, and polished copper pipe shelving stocked with backlit jars of preserved lemons. The kitchen sends out much to love, with Mediterranean and Italian accents to keep it all very interesting and delicious. Estrella pasta, star-shaped rigatoni dressed with crushed chicken liver, herbs, and pecorino, is a savory delight; crackling skin pork belly is seasonally plated with kale, blistered shisito peppers, and fuyu persimmon; and the yuzu soufflé with kalamansi curd is phenomenal.",Contemporary,"345 Park Ave. South, New York 10019",62.0,NY,4.3,106,2,2,0,0,37.0,10019
Gastroteca,0.0,"Astoria gets a much-needed jolt of rustic Italian cooking with Gastroteca, a charming new restaurant courtesy of Chef/owner John Parlatore. Tucked into a lovely corner location with enormous framed windows, exposed brick, and movies being projected onto the wall behind the bar, this is a fun spot but with a serious menu-the latter brought to life by a technically talented culinary team. The ingredient-driven menu offers a wonderful selection of crostini to start. Don't miss the one with Sicilian pineapple, mascarpone, chili flakes, or the avocado-before diving into the likes of linguini al limone with a poached egg and grated lemon zest; or fragrant, oven-roasted rosemary chicken, paired with creamy mashed potatoes and chicken gravy.",Italian,"33-02 34th Ave., Astoria 11106",37.0,NY,4.2,66,2,45,0,0,37.0,11106

This Meatpacking hot spot, courtesy of Mario Carbone, Rich Torrisi, and Jeff Zalaznick, is simply awash with color. From the waitstaff's polo shirts to the vivid, vibrant food, and even the bowls in which it's served, this kaleidoscope of sunny, southern European colors will simply make you feel better about life. It all happens in a glass box under the High Line designed by Renzo Piano-and Carmen Miranda would love the bar. Notionally described as ""Italian coastal cuisine,"" the food's about fish, vegetables, and sharing; and comes with an obvious health dividend.

The Ribbon,0.0,"Eric and Bruce Bromberg, the talented brothers behind the city's Blue Ribbon empire, strike again-this time in an enormous, industrial-chic space featuring a bustling bar and long communal tables up front; and a handsome, light-filled dining room with a visible kitchen. The Ribbon's well-sourced menu is an ode to classic American dishes, with a fantastic rotating butcher's board; a tempting raw bar; and a roster of burger variations, including oxtail and mushroom. Don't miss the house-made cavatelli tossed with shredded chicken, creamy artichoke hearts, blistered cherry tomatoes, and tender wilted spinach. The juicy, spit-roasted Amish chicken marinated in sage and Riesling, and served with spicy mustard and crispy sage leaves, is yet another delight.",American,"20 W. 72nd St., New York 10023",62.0,NY,4.1,37,3,2,0,0,37.0,10023
Sweet Yummy House,0.0,"This tiny, impeccably clean dining room is drawing diners left and right to Elmhurst these days. But wait, you argue-isn't this just another Chinese joint along a stretch of Broadway filled with such Chinese joints? Not quite. In fact, Sweet Yummy House is a diamond in the rough for those hunting down authentic spice levels and Taiwanese specialties they've never heard of. A meal might kick off with a duo of sautéed cabbages, one cooked in a delicate Taiwanese style, the other in the Shanghai tradition, sporting fiery oil. Then move on to tender, crispy chicken and pickled turnips in a nose-twitching spicy sauce; before lingering over deep and dark cold jelly, rendered Chengdu-style, with slippery mung bean noodles and lip-numbing Sichuan peppercorns.",Chinese,"83-13 Broadway, Elmhurst 11373",37.0,NY,3.6,15,1,29,0,0,18.5,11373
Tempura Matsui,1.0,"With a whopping 40 years of experience in Japan under his belt, tempura master Chef Masao Matsui requires just three ingredients-flour, water, and egg-to transform a larder of exceptionally fresh seafood and vegetables into a feast unlike any other in New York City. Tempura Matsui is tucked into the corner of a non-descript residential tower, lending an air of Japanese authenticity from its location that's amplified by a luxuriously old-world interior. A counter surrounding the chef's station seats a row of Matsui aficionados set comfortably with lacquer trays, handmade ceramic platters, and gorgeous implements, while a handful of booths offer a much more limited view of the virtuoso proceedings. Diners hoping for fare with American flair will be disappointed, as the food here caters to students of traditional Japanese cuisine. Chef Matsui is a watchful presence, guiding his sous-chefs to produce pieces that are pale gold, delicately crisp, and perfectly cooked. House-made goma dofu, chawan mushi, and sashimi begin the feast, but as lovely as these bites are, they are merely the opening act for the divine tempura-mouthwatering shrimp head, sweet hunk of King crabmeat, and seaweed-wrapped scallop.",Japanese,"222 E. 39th St., New York 10158",112.5,NY,4.1,10,4,55,1,1,112.5,10158
Thai Rock,0.0,"The ""rock"" in Thai Rock is not just a reference to the restaurant's location in the beachside Rockaways, but a nod to the live music that takes over after the sun dips down. Inside, you'll find tightly packed wooden tables and comfortable high-backed chairs, but the large uncovered patio overlooking the bay is certainly the place to be come summer. The menu covers the usual Thai standards-think pad Thai, curries and various stir fries-as well as a few Northern Thai specialties, with aplomb. Don't miss the plump and tender dumplings stuffed with crunchy turnips, peanuts, and fragrant garlic; refreshing chicken larb gai, laced with a bright and zesty lime sauce featuring mint and scallion; or the delicious and very savory Issan sausage.",Thai,"375 Beach 92nd St., Far Rockaway 11693",37.0,NY,4.2,65,2,101,0,0,37.0,11693
Balvanera,0.0,"A balanced taste of Argentina is the centerpiece of this lively bistro, which is a destination for beautifully marbled, expertly grilled meats and super-fresh veggies. Service is attentive and free of attitude in a neighborhood where this is all too common, and whitewashed brick walls alongside tightly packed wooden tables highlight the low key, welcoming scene. Balvanera's versatile menu is designed for sharing, from the authentically flaky empanadas with a zippy chimichurri to succulent house-made chorizo, served simply with a slice of smoky roasted red pepper. Meats are a must, including the dry-aged, grilled bone-in rib eye, garnished with crisp watercress.

Owned and guided by local personality and beloved chef, Vittorio Asoli (his cooking classes are televised on a local community channel), Trattoria Romana da Vittorio offers a cozy reprieve from the busy avenue outside, with diners huddling over snug tables or gathering at a communal table to chat up their neighbors.

Dirty French,0.0,"Dirty French is Major Food Group's stab at a hotel restaurant-and what a theatrical, charismatic stab it is. Settled in the Ludlow Hotel, this space shares the neighborhood's irreverent attitude, from the pink neon signs at the door to the casual kicks on the hipster waiters. Tables are tightly packed and lively conversations drown out funky music. This truly unique restaurant designs French-inspired bistro fare with colonial meanderings. Start off with fluffy flatbread slathered with fromage blanc. Then, sample the exquisitely executed mille-feuille of trumpet mushrooms in a verdant pool of green curry with pickled hot peppers.

Nerai,0.0,"Nerai endeavors to transport diners to Santorini, creating a stark contrast to its rather stiff midtown surrounds. A resort-chic vibe echoes through the whitewashed walls, sea-blue accents, and lots of cool marble. But the holiday ends there, as this crowd is all about business-especially at lunch. The fresh, light cuisine begins with beautifully prepared starters like tender, enticingly charred octopus atop chickpeas, roasted pepper, and quick-pickled onions drizzled with lemon and olive oil. Grilled sea bass is a flawless shade of white, salty and crisp-skinned alongside seasonal vegetables like zucchini and buttery pea purée.

Arrogant Swine,0.0,"A boon to this otherwise industrial warehouse neighborhood, Arrogant Swine's whitewashed brick walls and rows of picnic tables steadily fill with hungry patrons. Striking exterior wall murals and the aroma of sweet smoke both impress from the approach. Heat lamps extend the season for savoring slow-cooked pork outdoors, with rock music and a smoke-fueled barbecue buzz in the background. Whole hog barbecue is the specialty here-smoked slow and whole over live embers, resulting in tender, glistening meat. The loin, shoulder, jowl, and more are then chopped or pulled and tossed with Carolina-style vinegar sauce. Sides complete the downhome experience, especially their traditional cornpone (savory cornbread in an iron skillet with bacon drippings and slaw).",Barbecue,"173 Morgan Ave., Brooklyn 11237",18.5,NY,4.0,58,1,12,0,0,27.75,11237
Lupulo,0.0,"Located at the base of Eventi, a Kimpton Hotel, Chef George Mendes' elegant restaurant is a beautiful, industrial-chic ode to the casual home cooking of Portugal. Food voyeurs should vie for a seat at the bar, where they can eye fresh seafood lined up in plump, shimmering rows or enjoy the action behind the glass wall of the semi-open kitchen. Otherwise, a seat in the bustling dining room, decked out in gorgeous Portuguese tiles and hip lobster-trap lights, ought to do the trick.Try the espargos assados, a dish of tender, spit-grilled spring asparagus topped with shaved dried sea urchin, sorrel, olive oil and a dust of sea salt; or the wickedly good frango piri-piri, grilled to perfection and served with its mouthwatering namesake pepper sauce.",Portuguese,"835 Sixth Ave., New York 10001",37.0,NY,4.0,59,3,85,0,0,49.5,10001
Kang Suh,0.0,"A longtime favorite of Korean barbecue fans, this lively yet homey joint delivers an authentic and charming experience. Donning an old-school vibe, the room may seem trapped in time, but be assured as there is delish food and free-flowing soju on deck here. Bypass the first floor and find a roost on the second level, where warm, almost maternal servers with a sense of humor present an array of fragrant grilled meats. The haemool pa jeon is a flaky seafood pancake and excellent starter that may be trailed by delicate slices of galbi sizzling on the grill. Further indulge this meat feast with jaeyook gui or marinated pork grilled to pink perfection.

Hometown Bar-B-Que,0.0,"Texas-style barbecue has come to Brooklyn, even if this 'cue begins in an 18-foot smoke pit located a few blocks away, thereby keeping its on-site kitchen free from wood smoke. Instead, it remains focused on creamy mac n' cheese, whiskey sour pickles, and mayo-mustardy potato salad. Meats arrive sweet and tender enough to have a caramel crunch, while smoky sausages snap and explode with juice and chili-spiced bite-each is sold by the plump quarter-pound link. Ribs are cooked until the moment before they fall off the bone; and desserts feature Steve's Key lime pie locally made in Red Hook. The warehouse-like space is clad in repurposed wood with communal picnic tables lending an intimate and friendly vibe.

Okonomi,0.0,"A small counter and a handful of tables is the extent of this tiny café headed by Chef Yuji Haraguchi, famous for his ramen pop-ups. Regardless of the time of day, Okonomi's delightfully unconstrained Japanese cuisine is a compelling reason to visit. Locally grown produce and domestic fish are the foundation of the high-quality ichiju sansei, a set lunch of shioyaki (salt-grilled) or miso-marinated broiled fish, rice, miso soup, and shira-ae (wilted greens with a tofu dressing). Come evening, the focus shifts to ramen, with each steaming bowl bearing the distinctive hand of the skilled chef. A surf-and-turf broth stocked with thin, straight noodles and roasted fish is just one example; while broth-less mazeman is dressed for the season.",Japanese,"150 Ainslie St., Brooklyn 11211",18.5,NY,4.6,103,1,55,0,0,18.5,11211
Cherche Midi,0.0,"Restaurateur Keith McNally went back to his bistro roots with Cherche Midi, his restaurant on a bustling SoHo epicenter of sorts. Romantic, French, and timeless, this inviting space is filled with spectacular flower arrangements, burgundy leather booths, antique mirrors, and a semi-round bar with wood stools. A pot de fromage sets the tone for the meal. This luscious parmesan custard, served with toast points slathered in anchovy butter, is simple, satisfying with just the right amount of richness. At lunch, a steak sandwich with aged Gruyère and bacon marmalade on a Balthazar-baked brioche bun is a hit. At dinner, opt for elevated classics like the bone-in skate wing meunière with onion-fennel soubise.

Streetbird Rotisserie,0.0,"Chef Marcus Samuelsson's latest Harlem hot spot is a funky corner devoted to slow-roasted chicken and old-school street-style. Wade through the boisterous, rum punch-fueled crowd and enter this party to find splashes of custom graffiti, eye-popping murals, and lighting fixtures made from cassette tapes, drum sets, and bicycle tires. Despite all this sensory overload, it is impossible not to notice the plump, auburn birds spinning in the glass-fronted oven. Tender, juicy, and exceptionally flavorful, they steal the show and are supported by the chef's signature mash-up of global flavors: green papaya salad, jasmine fried rice, and cornbread.

Patroon,0.0,"For those in the know, this elegant canteen needs no introduction. Patroon exudes the air of a private club-one where suited professionals huddle over drinks at the sleek bar; and dining rooms fill with power lunchers who smoke cigars on the rooftop. That this restaurant draws a devoted crowd of regulars should come as no surprise; the maître d' and his gracious servers are top-notch and the kitchen team is highly competent. Come dinnertime, the classic cooking is especially impressive: bracing ceviche may feature Long Island fluke; then Dover sole is plated tableside; and light yet satisfying leek gratin caters to diners who would rather invest the calories elsewhere-say a fine pour from the well-curated wine list or a perfect crème brulée for dessert.",American,"160 E. 46th St., New York 10017",112.5,NY,4.0,42,4,2,0,0,112.5,10017
Sushi Yasaka,0.0,"There are no decorative distractions at this efficient if spare sushi-ya located a few steps below street level. The simple space offers three rows of tables, unadorned white walls, and a well-lit counter in the rear, and is warmed up by enthusiastic servers. Devoted customers know the draw here is not atmosphere, but the quality and excellent value omakase. Fish can be surprisingly luscious, especially the salmon, which has a remarkably clean finish and great salty note. The medium fatty tuna needs nothing more than a kiss of soy sauce. A 12-course omakase might also include giant clam, uni, sea eel, fluke, smelt roe, and for dessert, tamago. The kanto soba is excellent too, with a rich soy-bonito broth with scallions, seaweed, and a fish cake.",Japanese,"251 W. 72nd St., New York 10024",37.0,NY,4.4,166,2,55,0,0,37.0,10024
Mu Ramen,0.0,"What began as a pop-up found an insanely popular home behind an unmarked door in this industrial yet residential nook of Long Island City. Lines never cease; arrive early if possible. A thick wood block serves as a communal table in the dining room, where slurpers can witness the focus and dedication of chefs working within an open kitchen in the back. The kitchen's methodical devotion results in a superior bowl of ramen. In the spicy miso ramen, springy noodles (from Sun Noodle) are nested in a red miso and pork based soup of rich bone broth that slowly simmers for over 24 hours. Topped with scallion, ground pork, sesame, and chili oil, it is one of many rewarding bowls.

The Black Ant,0.0,"Bringing a dose of Mexico City chic to the East Village, this restaurant takes its name from the ancient Mesoamerican fable of an ant and incorporates that imagery throughout the setting. Black and white checkerboard flooring, blackboard wall tiles bearing white ants, and a very cool giant ant mural reinforce the theme. The menu is an unrestricted look at Mexican cuisine. It is only fitting that specialties here include the Climbing Ant cocktail combining tequila, Aperol, and mole bitters; freshly-mashed guacamole seasoned with crushed ant salt; and grasshopper-crusted shrimp tacos. Insect-free creations are just as appealing, as in tacos stuffing tender masa tortillas with large chunks of battered and fried cod cheek, aïoli, and cabbage-mango slaw.",Mexican,"60 Second Ave., New York 10003",37.0,NY,3.9,48,2,66,0,0,37.0,10003
Oiji,0.0,"Headed by a duo of young Korean-born chefs who met at the Culinary Institute of America and put their education to work in the stellar kitchens of Bouley and Gramercy Tavern, Oiji dishes out an updated take on Korean flavors. The intimate dining room is small and moodily lit, with an open kitchen that allows diners to see and hear the action as it takes place. Polished and refined yet familiar, the concise menu of small plates offers an appealing approach. Decadently rich and creamy, the wild sesame soup-a dairy-free sensation-is poured over wild mushrooms, chewy rice cake, and black truffle. Pine smoke-infused mackerel is served with a wedge of lemon and yuzu-soy sauce to brighten the fragrant and oily-rich fish. Of course, the kimchi is not to be missed.",Korean,"119 First Ave., New York 10003",37.0,NY,4.3,36,3,58,0,0,37.0,10003
Thelma on Clinton,0.0,"With its cozy bistro décor and sincere, down-to-earth service, Thelma on Clinton is the kind of unpretentious restaurant everyone wants around the corner from home. Owner Melissa O'Donnell is a longtime fixture on New York's restaurant scene, and Thelma is her latest contribution-this time, in her old Salt Bar space. Does she kill it? She kills it: and she might just get double credit for producing such delicious fare in a kitchen smaller than some local apartment kitchens. Kick things off with the scrumptious bacon-wrapped dates, laced in a irresistible, sticky maple sauce. Then move on to tender spring pea and asparagus risotto with plump peas, crunchy asparagus and Grana Padano cheese; or olive oil-poached codfish in a lovely citrus sauce.",American,"29A Clinton St., New York 10002",37.0,NY,4.1,15,2,2,0,0,37.0,10002
Kung Fu Little Steamed Buns Ramen,0.0,"With its lineup of traditionally prepared comfort food, this steamy joint kicks Hell's Kitchen's Chinese competitors to the curb. Set among the bright lights of the Theater District yet more indicative of the noodle houses found south of Canal Street or along Flushing Avenue, the perpetually packed gem offers a so-so ambience but very friendly service. Hand-pulled and hand-cut noodles are stir-fried with a number of mouthwatering accompaniments; while the dumpling variety is so great it's almost impossible to focus. Herb-spiked pork and shrimp wonton soup is well worth the 20-minute wait, allowing diners plenty of time to devour pan-fried Peking duck bundles and scallion pancakes stuffed with sliced beef; or steamed buns full of mushroom and bok choy.",Chinese,"811 Eighth Ave., New York 10019",18.5,NY,4.1,141,1,5,0,0,18.5,10019
Kitchen 79,0.0,"Shiny black subway tiles and glowing fixtures set a date-worthy tone at this new Thai standout. Patient, helpful servers assist in exploring the menu, focused mainly on dishes of southern Thailand. Patrons can choose to be as adventurous as the sometimes familiar yet authentic and funky menu allows. Thick green curry (gaeng kiew warn) is packed with tender shrimp, bamboo shoots, eggplant, Chinese long beans, and holy basil simmered in coconut milk with pleasantly restrained spicing. A whole flounder (pla neung ma nao) is brilliant, distinct, and steamed to perfection with sour and spicy notes from garlic, minced ginger, and a Thai hot sauce. Flat noodles (ka nom jeen gang tai pla) with pumpkin, mackerel, and curry paste is a powerful, spicy dish.",Thai,"37-70 79th St., Jackson Heights 11372",18.5,NY,4.4,31,2,101,0,0,37.0,11372
Aster,1.0,"Fine dining SF-style means hip soundtracks, spare spaces, and going to dinner in jeans, but this newcomer makes all of those trappings seem cool, never forced. Set in a quiet, residential corridor of the Mission, Aster's caramel-colored banquettes, wood tabletops, and strands of LED lights make for a studied, yet casual vibe. This is the kind of place where even the attentive, hospitable service manages to feel laid-back, but getting in will require some effort-If you can't score a reservation, line up early to snag a walk-in table. Start with an aperitif as you peruse Chef Brett Cooper's elegant menu, which deftly interplays sweet, tangy, earthy, and salty elements in dishes like blanched asparagus with egg yolk, grilled spring onions, and shreds of ham hock. Packets of black cod, wrapped in chard leaves and steamed until tender, arrive in a complex, smoky bone broth, while deliriously rich pork head croquettes are balanced by a zippy arugula salad with blood orange kosho. Aster's light food makes it easy to save room for the excellent desserts, including a decadent and refreshing beet-and-blood orange crémeux, or a raspberry meringue with just a hint of Sichuan peppercorn.",Californian,"1001 Guerrero St., San Francisco 94110",62.0,CA,4.6,46,4,2,1,1,112.5,94110

Named for resort founder Samuel Brannan, it boasts a sizable lounge full of comfortable couches and bright murals, a Mission Revival dining room with a stylish country-Western vibe, and a big patio, complete with a geyser-fed water feature. The unpretentious atmosphere extends to the plates, from a lively gazpacho made from fresh local tomatoes and endowed with plenty of jalapeño bite to a delectable seared chicken paillard with rosemary Hollandaise as well as a potato-and-green bean salad.

The long, narrow space, with its rustic wood beams, wood furnishings, and oversized mirrors, has a contemporary vibe that contrasts nicely with the homey food. The lunch menu is full of light, yet satisfying dishes, like a Greek salad packed with crunchy cucumber, ripe tomato, and tangy feta. A juicy, well-seasoned lamb burger is topped with goat cheese, tomato, and crunchy red onion. Dinner is heartier with moussaka, slow-braised lamb shank with orzo, and lamb chops among other options.

Rusty's Southern,0.0,"In the hard-charging techie wilds of San Francisco, homesick transplants can find Southern comfort at this Tenderloin newbie, which eschews fine-dining frills for rib-sticking simplicity. Its environs are a bit sketchy after dark, but that doesn't deter the young and stylish crowds, who swill craft beers at the front bar and congregate in groups in the casual, wood-accented dining room. Rustic and homey treats arrive in abundant portions: tangy, smoky Brunswick stew is loaded with pork, chicken, collards, lima beans and tomatoes, while expertly brined fried chicken is encased in a crunchy, golden-brown breading.

With eight to ten daily pies to choose from, there's something for everyone. Bring the kids and go to town on the zesty Diavola, topped with spicy salame, minced pepperoncini, and crisp arugula, or try the classic Americana, a tasty mix of ham, onion, sausage, mushrooms, and black olives.

Octavia,1.0,"Chef/owner Melissa Perello, already a local culinary personality with Frances, shines even brighter at this new sequel in the tony Lower Pacific Heights neighborhood. Packed with a dynamic and diverse group of diners, the airy and open space is designed with a minimalist-chic eye, from the white-tiled kitchen to those raw-wood benches lined with wool-encased pillows. Service is enthusiastic and genuinely hospitable. Chef Perello has a gift for elevating straightforward dishes through the use of pristine ingredients and technique, and her magic is in full force here with dishes like golden saffron fettuccine twirled with caramelized garlic, wilted fennel, and roasted tomatoes. Luscious roasted king salmon with fingerling potatoes in a dill-infused crème fraîche sauce may seem basic, but in her hands, it's anything but. Even a simple grilled toast, with warm, creamy house-made ricotta and charred spring onion, is revelatory. At Octavia, the golden touch extends to the exquisite desserts, which might include a nectarine ""float"" with nectarine ice cream and soda, mint, and lavender, and the thoughtful wine list brims with unusual options.

A gleaming open kitchen and burnt caramel-hued banquettes pop against the dark lacquered walls, while sparkling chandeliers and shelves of cooking and design books further punctuate the upscale look of this intimate room. You'll feel as though you're dining in a chef's private atelier, complete with a polished, professional, and tight-knit staff that delivers truly impressive service. While the feast set forth by Chef Cantu is inspired by Mexican flavors, it is modern Californian at its foundation. Produce plucked from nearby farms are transformed into stimulating bites to begin this tasting menu; highlights from which have included delicious interpretations of menudo featuring fresh raw hamachi slices doused with a succulent tripe broth; and esquites that top a creamy sweet corn pudding with charred kernels and decadent Santa Barbara uni. Fourteen-day dry-aged Wagyu ribeye cap is grilled over the binchotan and served with charred onion, dabs of avocado purée, tomatillo salsa, as well as puffy, griddled sourdough tortillas.

A refreshing Clifton special cocktail (with genever and coconut water) is the perfect counterpart to intriguing snacks like silky tuna poke atop crunchy nori crackers, smoky beef tongue wrapped in fluffy clamshell buns, and Flintstone-sized beef ribs in a sweet-spicy red chili sauce. Be sure to save room for the tangy, dense cardamom cheesecake with pistachio and Cara Cara oranges.",Hawaiian,"871 Sutter St., San Francisco 94109",62.0,CA,4.6,111,3,23,0,0,62.0,94109
Bradley's Fine Diner,0.0,"Like a grown-up greasy spoon, this newcomer from award-winning chef, Bradley Ogden, updates American favorites with quality ingredients and a dash of creativity. A delightful riff on Buffalo wings pairs crispy chunks of pork belly with a luscious Maytag blue cheese soufflé, while free-range chicken breast arrives moist and juicy, accompanied by a squash-centric panzanella. A piping-hot apple cobbler and killer butterscotch pudding are some of the stars on the dessert menu. The sizable space has hip touches that appeal to the crowd of affluent Atherton locals, like a wood art piece embedded with chef's knives, a glowing neon sign, and wraparound porches for warm nights.

Rose Pistola,0.0,"A new chef has enlivened the menu at this longtime North Beach spot, which stands out from the Disneyland-like crowd of tourist-baiting Italian restaurants along Columbus Avenue. The kitchen can satisfy the pasta-and-wine grind, but it's capable of a lot more. Perfectly tender and crisp-fried calamari gets a punch from an almond salsa verde dip, garlic-sautéed fresh spinach is bright and delicate, and the pan-fried chicken Milanese is a crisp, well-seasoned work of art. Rose Pistola is also a cut above in terms of décor, thanks to huge front windowpanes, subdued mosaic-tile floors, and a large, dark wood bar. Linger over a slice of buttery, cream-filled sacripantina cake, and engage in some great people-watching on the busy thoroughfare outside.",Italian,"532 Columbus Ave., San Francisco 94133",37.0,CA,3.8,92,3,54,0,0,37.0,94133
Kitchen Istanbul,0.0,"This cheerful Inner Richmond spot has retained the chef, managing team, and décor of previous occupant Troya, but taken its menu in a more exclusively Turkish direction. The results-like a sublime lentil soup richly puréed and made slightly tart with lemon, or a juicy, perfectly grilled duo of lamb meatballs over basmati rice-will transport you to the Aegean sea. A Mediterranean oasis surrounded by dozens of Chinese restaurants, Kitchen Istanbul is bright and well-lit with red walls donning sleek black-and-white framed photos. The friendly staff is quick to recommend an unusual Turkish wine; if you're willing to put yourself in their hands, they're also happy to whip up a mini tasting menu of highlights, from creamy hummus to briny sardines.",Turkish,"349 Clement St., San Francisco 94118",37.0,CA,4.1,84,2,102,0,0,37.0,94118
Belga,0.0,"Belgian brews and bites are the cornerstones of this new recruit in the former Café des Amis, which has kept its brasserie look but pivoted from Paris to Brussels. All the classics are accounted for: well-salted frites with garlic aïoli; bowls of mussels; and of course, house-made sausages-try the combo board, which comes with andouille, boudin noir, boudin blanc, and currywurst, not to mention a generous bowl of spaetzle. Flatbreads and salads round things out. The Euro-café vibe is fun with red banquettes, classic bistro chairs, and marble floors to complement the big beer selection (both European and domestic) and cocktails.

Il Casaro,0.0,"In a sea of too-touristy Italian joints, Il Casaro is the rare North Beach spot that delivers the goods: Neapolitan-style pizza cooked to crispy perfection in a bright red wood-fired oven. Whether you opt for the classic Margherita or the zippy diavola (with spicy salami and Calabrian chiles), you're sure to achieve carbohydrate bliss. Throw in an antipasto or salad and a silky panna cotta with raspberry coulis, and you're all set-at an affordable price, to boot. Il Casaro's space is simple but hip, with reclaimed wood, polished concrete floors, and utensils in empty San Marzano tomato cans. Don't expect more than cursory service, as the restaurant is always packed and doesn't take reservations: waits can run an hour or more at peak times.",Pizza,"348 Columbus Ave., San Francisco 94133",37.0,CA,4.7,130,2,54,0,0,37.0,94133
Omakase,1.0,"An ""omakase"" places the guests in the hands of the chef-and indeed the only dining option at this tiny new Edomae-style restaurant are three chef-designed tasting menus, clocking in at $100, $150, or $200. Sound risky? It isn't: trust us, this is an experience worth relinquishing all control for. Housed in an area of SoMa popping with big tech companies and modern lofts, Omakase is a quiet little oasis of elegant minimalism. The tiny dining room consists of an L-shaped counter offering 14 seats (so yes, you'll definitely want to make reservations) facing the chefs. But, while all eyes are focused on the food, you won't get the impression these chefs think they're rock stars. On the contrary, it's not uncommon for them to inquire if the size of the sushi rice is appropriate for each guest's mouth; and the chefs and servers both bow profusely and offer their gratitude upon exit. A night in their capable hands will reveal plate after plate of fresh sushi and sashimi (flown in three times a week from the Tsukiji fish market) and unique little dishes like a seaweed and fresh herb salad, laced with lovely strands of Okinawan sea grapes, served over cured whitefish and accompanied by white tuna temarizushi.",Japanese,"665 Townsend St., San Francisco 94103",112.5,CA,4.1,11,4,55,1,1,112.5,94103
Lazy Bear,1.0,"Communal dining is the name of the game at this white-hot restaurant. Billed as a fine dining dinner party, Lazy Bear is an underground phenom ""gone legit,"" meaning your average Joe can now score a seat. That is, if they can jump through a few hoops: you'll need to buy a ticket in advance, and once you do, you'll be e-mailed a list of house rules you should read in earnest. Fortunately, this hip hottie delivers. The nightly tasting menu is dished out in a cool, bi-level warehouse and starts with aperitifs served alongside small bites upstairs in the loft, before moving downstairs to a dining room that boasts two giant tree slabs as communal tables, each lined with 20 chairs. Diners are given a pamphlet with the menu (there's space for note-taking underneath) and are invited to walk into the kitchen to chat with the cooks themselves. The young crowd loves this kind of chef worship, and digging into David Barzelay's luscious fare, we're inclined to agree. A saffron dish of creamy Anson Mills grits arrives with fresh lobster, pickled chard, Tokyo turnips, and prawn roe crisps; while tender caramelized squab is paired with lightly roasted sweet pear, a reduced jus, and crushed spices for dipping.",Contemporary,"3416 19th St., San Francisco 94110",112.5,CA,4.6,64,4,2,1,1,112.5,94110
Ramen Gaijin,0.0,"""Gaijin"" is the none-too-polite Japanese term for a foreigner, but the American chefs of this clandestine noodle joint clearly take pride in their outsider status, fusing local ingredients with traditional technique. Finding Gaijin is a journey in itself (it's actually in the back of another restaurant), but the friendly and casual vibe rewards the effort. The best seats are at the counter, where you can chat with the chef as he assembles bowls of light, fresh shoyu ramen filled with thick house-made rye noodles and caramelized pork belly chashu. Appetizers are also notable, like a surprisingly elegant salad of smoked cod and baby gem lettuces. And, don't leave without dessert: the black-sesame ice cream with miso caramel is creative and delicious.",Japanese,"6948 Sebastopol Ave., Sebastopol 95472",37.0,CA,4.6,43,1,55,0,0,18.5,95472
Harvest Table,0.0,"Charlie Palmer's Harvest Inn is now also a culinary destination with the arrival of Harvest Table. Its Californian menu relies on local purveyors and the Inn's own gardens for ingredients, and guests are encouraged to tour these grounds before or after meals. The space is simple and appealingly rustic thanks in part to the large brick fireplace. Two covered patios offer a comfy perch to enjoy the natural beauty of the inn. Smooth dark wood tables can be seen groaning under the weight of such enjoyable items as crunchy pig's head fritters coupled with a light frisée salad and creamy gribiche. Batons of yellowfin are then crowned with shaved fennel for balance in texture as well as pickled Fresno chilies for that bit of heat.

Prubechu,0.0,"Owned by two natives of Guam, Prubechu is the only Bay Area restaurant that serves the island's Chamorro cuisine. It's a shoebox-sized space without a full kitchen, but the intrepid staff manages to turn out utterly unique, utterly delicious meals like none you've ever had. Diners can choose between a tasting menu offering intricate Chamorro interpretations, or a small selection of homey, à la carte dishes. Either way, the results are thrilling, from a flavorful chicken sausage steamed with luscious coconut milk in a banana leaf, to umami-rich dried pork shoulder with nettle purée. The nutty, creamy toasted rice porridge with caramel soy and a tempura-battered soft-cooked egg is a standout, as is a gently sweet and caramelized banana donut.",Chamorro,"2847 Mission St., San Francisco 94110",37.0,CA,4.6,28,2,4,0,0,37.0,94110
Dry Creek Kitchen,0.0,"With its white tablecloths, plush cushioned banquettes, and formally attired waiters, this Charlie Palmer-owned restaurant is dressy enough for a special occasion. Yes, it's pricey, but the food is unpretentious, the servers are friendly, and there's more than enough wine-country charm to go around. A cast-iron pan of fluffy focaccia precedes the no-fuss Californian food, like crisp Delta asparagus and salty boquerones with a tangy buttermilk-lemon vinaigrette. The pan-seared local halibut arrives atop a summery succotash of fava beans, sweet corn, and cherry tomatoes, and desserts include a quirky take on s'mores complete with Pop Rocks. To ease the sting on your wallet, come at lunchtime as the prix-fixe is a particularly good deal.",Californian,"317 Healdsburg Ave., Healdsburg 95448",62.0,CA,4.2,53,3,23,0,0,62.0,95448

The upstairs restaurant is simple and airy, with wood furnishings, wide windows, and engaging servers at the ready. The American fare on the menu is unfussy and skillfully prepared, from butter-sautéed wild mushroom panzanella with chunks of torn sourdough and bacon-shallot vinaigrette, to a juicy, generously portioned half roast chicken, accompanied by toast slathered in chicken-liver mousse.

San Tung,0.0,"If you don't know what to order, just repeat after us: dry-fried chicken wings. Tossed in a chili-flecked ginger glaze, they're the reason foodies flock to this tasty, Americanized Chinese spot, write their names on a whiteboard, endure a long wait on the sidewalk, and finally eat at a communal table with strangers. It's all part of the restaurant's ramshackle appeal (as are the ultra-affordable prices). Even if poultry's not your thing, the menu's other offerings are well worth the effort it takes to eat here: dry-fried prawns are tossed in a sweet-and-spicy chili-garlic sauce, and hot and salty twice-cooked pork is fried with a heap of bell peppers and dried red chilies.

Mourad,1.0,"With the debut of this glamorous outpost at the base of the PacBell building, Aziza Chef/owner Mourad Lahlou has become a big-city slicker. The area's young, food-obsessed techies practically flock to this grand space, replete with soaring ceilings, glowing central columns, and a glass-enclosed wine cellar catwalk. Chef Lahlou's food retains the influence of his Moroccan upbringing, with dishes like duck confit basteeya rolled in thin sheets of flaky pastry. However, diners can also look forward to new levels of creativity using ingredients from around the globe. Even a simple dish of carrots gets unexpected heft from meaty dates and crunchy pecans, not to mention a hit of spice from urfa pepper. Then a wreath of eggplant packs a punch of texture and flavor into one beautiful dish; while tender, smoky octopus, served in a spicy lamb merguez broth with chickpea purée, is Californian and Moroccan all at once. The visionary chef's attention to detail extends to the exceptional drinks. But, those travelling in groups may also want to consider the larger La'Acha menu, which offers family-style Moroccan dishes.

The self-described ""modern Midwestern"" menu pulls influences and ingredients from around the globe, yet maintains a distinctly American feel in dishes like cotton cake-an airy Japanese-style cheesecake kept light with streaks of persimmon jam and basil streusel.

A contemporary vision of Spanish cuisine turns out pintxos to start-try the Gilda, a single bite skewer featuring a brown anchovy, pickled guindilla pepper, and a manzanilla olive.

For the best people-watching, score one of the semicircular booths edging the room. A massive single tiger prawn, served simply on ice with lemon, is a tasty, visually stunning starter. Steaks range from petite filets to dry-aged 24-ounce cowboy cuts with a list of big reds to match.

The bulk of the sprawling space is devoted to Green Street Smoked Meats, a barbecue joint where crowds of cool kids sit side-by-side downing beers and heaps of pulled pork, brisket, and Frito pie. More worthy of attention, however, is High Five Ramen, a downstairs nook where the queue for one of its 16-seats starts early. Once inside, slurp a bowl of the signature, crazy-spicy broth. Loaded with thin alkaline noodles, a slow-cooked egg, roasted pork belly, locally grown sprouts, and black garlic oil, this unique rendition is worth the burn.

The menu, at the moment anyway, is small but packs a big punch-what's available is seasonal, diverse, and extremely fresh.

The restaurant features an elevated roster of American classics including steaks, rotisserie chicken and seafood-not to mention a raw bar with Kansai-style box-pressed sushi.

Steak frites are no less appealing for their straightforward plating-a classic combination of juicy skirt steak and thin-cut potatoes with garlic aïoli for dipping.

Round bistro tables and bentwood chairs are clustered across the mosaic-tiled floor, while a broad, marble-topped bar is bustling with patrons from lunch to happy hour. French brasserie favorites dominate the menu, ranging from rustic French onion soup to lavish raw seafood plateaus. Steak frites are juicy and flavorsome with a tender prime cut of bavette, offered with five sauce options like a classic béarnaise or rich Roquefort.

The restaurant's approachable, community-minded take on straightforward seasonal food-along with its impressive drinks program-makes it easy to please. Even if you're not attending a Monday ""Community Night"" dinner alongside many of the purveyors whose ingredients appear on the plate, you'll find a fresh, flavorful mix of dishes. Crushed white bean bruschetta is topped with a sprightly herb and frisée salad, which is in turn dressed with a blood orange vinaigrette.

Consistently packed, the AvroKO-designed space boasts numerous kitchens churning out a wide range of dishes. Creative bites abound in the chef's omakase featuring torched baby squid wrapped in nori. Then a Hawaiian seaweed salad with diced nopales may be tailed by robata-grilled Wagyu skirt steak with foie gras, shisito pepper, and yuzu kosho.

Though the rollicking bar up front takes its cues from a swinging Wild West saloon, the rear dining room offers a more sedate-though still eclectic-setting for sipping house cocktails and chowing down on sensational smoked meats. You'll need two hands to hold homemade empanadas stuffed with combinations like Manchego cheese and shiitake mushrooms, and extra cottony white bread to soak up the juices of bone-in, wood-smoked chicken. Brisket chili is even more robust with a scoop of creamy mac and cheese-and if you're still hungry, soda floats with Bridgeport-made Filbert's root beer are the cherry on top.",Barbecue,"1800 S.

Share an order of prime rib poutine among friends-it's drenched in beef gravy and pepper jack cheese-or go whole hog with the prime rib sandwich, which is hand-carved to order and presented tableside with horseradish cream and au jus.

But even with all that design swag, the main draw at Pearl's Southern Comfort is still the food. For starters, there's their ace barbecue, but guests should hardly stop there. Try the enormous double cut pork chop, grilled to supple perfection and paired with ""dirty"" farro salad, Cajun slaw, and pork jus.

On the menu, sweet-and-sour babi panggang departs from its traditional pairing with roast pork to heighten succulent grilled shrimp and fragrant lemongrass lumpia.

A starter of chewy rosemary-sea salt monkey bread whets the palate, while rosy pink slices of slow-roasted bone-in prime rib, rubbed with a crust of fragrant herbs, take a classic hoagie to new heights. When paired with house-cut fries and creamy horseradish dip, it's a meal to rival a Porterhouse, but save room for dessert: a single-serving banana cream pie with loads of whipped cream is a whimsical final bite.",Steakhouse,"222 N.

No detail is overlooked. Delightfully, the food is amazingly tasty and just as pretty to look at. Don't miss the open-faced schnitzel sandwich, highlighting juicy pork over apple and kohlrabi slaw, aged Gouda, a fried egg, and drizzle of coarse mustard. Also a must do?

Then, Champagne lemon chicken, XO brandy beef chow fun, and sizzling Xi'an pork with a red chilli-and-black bean sauce all boast salty, sweet, and spicy notes.

Dolce offers a chic take on Italian dining, with a menu featuring pizzas, house-made pastas, and entrées like veal Milanese or fennel pollen-dusted roasted chicken.

Chef Michael Taus has designed a menu made for grazing: think charcuterie, cheese, and starters including a sunchoke dosa. Made from lentils and basmati rice, this lacy crêpe is topped with chunks of tender sunchokes in a spicy red curry sauce sweetened by golden raisins and candied pumpkin seeds.

With a plain, tavern-like bar up front as well as a bright, inviting dining room and counter (the best seat in the house) in back, this low-key spot is popular for a casual meal. The menu offers cool bites like the Juno queen, a special nigiri of salmon topped with spicy scallop and potato crunch; and hot treats like honey-glazed quail. Chef B.K. Park's omakase must be ordered 48-hours in advance, but with cleverly spun morsels like briefly torched prawn with pineapple salsa, pickled garlic oil-drizzled New Zealand King salmon, soy-marinated sea eel dabbed with ground sesame seeds, and spicy octopus temaki, it's a feast well worth the extra effort.",Japanese,"2638 N.

The no-frills, order-at-the-counter spot is simply adorned, with genuinely welcoming service that only adds to the charm. Every spoonful of Luella's andouille and chicken gumbo is one to remember, thanks to a roux that's been cooked for five (count 'em) hours. The hot, sugary beignets are a pastry wonder, and chicken and waffles drizzled with Bourbon syrup are Southern by way of Brussels, featuring thick, eggy Liège waffles standing in for the usual rounds.",Southern,"4609 N.

Their home-style cooking would make any Boricua proud, offering standards from mofongo to lechon and even the holiday favorite of coquito-with much less of the heaviness often associated with the traditional cuisine. As the story goes, the jibarito was created by Chicago's Puerto Rican community, and La Plena's rendition-featuring thin steak strips, garlicky mayonnaise, and melted cheese between fried flattened plantains-is an exceptional example.

Fans of Bourbon will delight in the Derby Day Mule, which swaps out vodka for Buffalo Trace. Pair your libation with rib-sticking dishes like a sandwich of garlic- and balsamic vinegar-roasted portobello mushroom caps layered with a runny egg, grilled tomato, and blue cheese; or a steaming bowl of braised duck soup complete with thick and silky pappardelle.

Smoky roasted feta arrives in a pool of balsamic vinegar and oil with a generous assortment of briny olives, while shatteringly crisp black trumpet mushrooms and pickled shallot add piquant crunch to Nantucket bay scallops.

In addition to excellent cuts of beef, Rural Society grills up stellar Maine lobster, chicken, and chops, while the oven produces mouthwatering Argentinean pizzas and homemade-spiced sausages.

Daniel,2.0,"The elegant façade, the revolving door, the sound of clinking glasses-even before you reach the dining room you feel a part of something special. This bastion of classical French cooking epitomises the ""special occasion,"" yet even those unencumbered by fiscal considerations treat it with respect. The dining room is dominated by the striking porcelain-tiled chandeliers hanging from the soaring ceiling. If you're on one of the raised tables you get to look down-literally rather than patronizingly-onto your fellow diners through the neo-classical arches. Yet thanks to the personable service, the grandeur of the room never stifles the animated atmosphere. The cooking is as sophisticated as the surroundings and the ingredients come from the top drawer. The kitchen has had an obvious classical education yet you never feel it is tied by the tyranny of tradition. Just order the succulent Niman Ranch lamb chops and you'll find them accompanied with quinoa mixed with avocado. Occasionally, over-enthusiastic garnishing can overawe the dish's main ingredient but there's no doubting this is a very capable kitchen.",French,"60 E. 65th St., New York 10065",112.5,NY,4.5,510,4,44,1,2,112.5,10065

Whatever the hype, Mr Chow still has it and Sutton suits along with their wealthy wives party here like it's 1999. Attentive service and flowing drinks keep everything moving as fans nibble away on the well-priced Beijing duck prix-fixe with four starters along with entrées. Tender orange chicken satay and water dumplings with seafood are tasty, but Dungeness crab sautéed with egg whites, and ma mignon, cubes of tender fried beef tossed in a sweet-spicy sauce laced with scallions truly get the crowd going.",Chinese,"324 E. 57th St., New York 10022",112.5,NY,3.7,64,3,29,0,0,112.5,10022

Inside, the dining room harkens back to the 80s with its mirrored bar and pink-and-black granite. Lalique crystal fixtures add a touch of timeless bling. The best way to begin a meal at Petrossian is to partake in some caviar, smoked salmon, or foie gras (all available for purchase next door in the boutique).

A pizzaiolo mans the wood-burning oven in the front, firing up a selection of seasonal pies that are popular with families.

Kokkari's sophisticated menu leans heavily on the wood grill and rotisserie, which produce smoky, juicy lamb souvlaki with warm pita and tangy chickpea salad; as well as charcoal-kissed, feta-stuffed calamari over fennel, oranges, and olive tapenade.

Then get your food at the counter and bring it to a first-come first-get table; or opt for a slightly less dizzying experience at a waitress-served table. Nothing's changed in the looks or taste.

A rotating list of Italian cheeses and cured meats makes a fine appetizer and prelude to a pasta course that shifts with the seasons.

Seem familiar by now? Well, these guys wrote the book. Service is laid-back and unpretentious, perhaps because they know the food does the talking here: a wildly fresh fennel, celery root, and parsley salad arrives with aged pecorino and a delicate lemon vinaigrette; while a tender tangle of linguini is laced with a fresh tomato broth studded with fava beans and garlic.",Italian,"457 Court St., Brooklyn 11231",37.0,NY,4.5,196,2,54,0,0,37.0,11231

Though it may seem old-fashioned for its high-tech Mountain View zip code, this former home, stuffed with flowers and Tiffany lamps, has a throwback appeal that's perfect for escaping the demands of technology. Outstanding, gracious servers only add to the pleasure. Two menus are offered in this dining room: an eight-course exploration into NorCal-centric seasonal fare, or a 17-course chef's tasting loaded with luxurious global ingredients. Both exhibit thoughtful technique, from supremely fresh abalone over creamy polenta and cured squab to golden-crusted halibut with parsnip purée, lobster, and chanterelle mushrooms. Even a simple cube of Crenshaw melon, strewn with prosciutto di Parma, dissolves magnificently in the mouth. Intimacy is at a premium in the petite space, where an upscale crowd comes to celebrate special occasions.

Tech money infuses the well-to-do suburb, and this show pony is a fine-dining favorite among wealthy local retirees. But even if you have to save your pennies, you will enjoy the creative and delectable dishes on offer here. These include a crunchy phyllo cannoli shell stuffed with smoked trout-mascarpone mousse and dusted with chives; or velvety sweet corn soup with a tangy chow-chow of pickled vegetables, smoked duck, and popped sorghum. Flaky butter-basted salmon rests in a bed of earthy porcini and fava beans, while tender chicken roulades are accented by chanterelles and sweet corn. A quenelle of blackberry sorbet served over honey-flavored tapioca pearls makes for a rich yet very refreshing finale.

That said, the cuisine is surprisingly approachable, with offerings like house charcuterie and a superb Pub burger available in the lounge and main dining areas. A crisp, lunchtime flatbread is loaded with flavor and all too easy to devour. The kitchen shines its brightest at dinner, with starters like octopus carpaccio adorned with shaved radish, tomato confit, cucumber brunoise, and a drizzle of paprika oil. Service is a priority, and this staff readily attends to every need-even grinding coffee to order as an accompaniment for warm, fluffy, sugar-dusted beignets served with creamy almond anglaise and tangy cranberry compote. The wine list is similarly designed to court the deepest of pockets, with an outstanding selection of French vintages and aged Bordeaux. On a budget? Aim for lunch, which is lighter not only in approach, but also on the wallet.",Gastropub,"2967 Woodside Rd., Woodside 94062",62.0,CA,4.4,121,3,10,1,1,37.0,94062
Buckeye Roadhouse,0.0,"This Marin hideout has welcomed generations of locals through its doors since 1937, even as its location on Highway 1 gave way to the more bustling 101. Enter the whitewashed craftsman building, and you'll be given your choice of dining in either the clubby bar or their grand dining room (complete with wood-paneled walls, red leather banquettes, and a tall fireplace). The food here is classical but never dull, with a simple menu of salads, sandwiches, barbecue, and meat from the wood grill. A brunchtime meal of eggs Benedict boasts tender rosemary ham and rich potato croquettes, while plump asparagus ravioli with lemon olive oil stars in the evening. Finish up with a slice of pie-the famous s'mores version or a tart Key lime are both winners.",American,"15 Shoreline Hwy., Mill Valley 94941",37.0,CA,4.4,97,3,2,0,0,37.0,94941
Nopa,0.0,"Before you're able to enjoy a single forkful at this Bay Area sensation, you'll have to secure a table-and that takes some serious effort. Reservations are snapped up at lightning speed, and hopeful walk-ins must lineup prior to the start of service to add their name to the list. The good news? Your efforts will be well rewarded. Inside, an open kitchen, soaring ceilings, and hordes of ravenous sophisticates produce a cacophonous setting in which to relish Nopa's wonderful, organic, wood-fired cuisine. Dig into a bruschetta of grilled levain spread with smashed avocado, pickled jalapeños, lemon-dressed arugula, and shaved mezzo secco, or go for the roasted King salmon fillet over creamed corn, smoky maitakes, crisp green beans, and sweet tomato confit.",Californian,"560 Divisadero St., San Francisco 94117",37.0,CA,4.4,793,3,2,0,0,37.0,94117
Bar Crudo,0.0,"Seafood, and plenty of it, is the specialty at this Divisadero hot spot. As the name suggests, their crudo is supreme: whether it's Arctic char with horseradish crème fraîche, wasabi tobiko, and dill; or perhaps raw scallop with sweet corn purée, tarragon oil, and popped sorghum, the combinations are fresh and delicious. Platters of shellfish are available, and there are a few hot dishes like head-on Louisiana prawns in a lobster broth, served beside a baby fennel-pea shoot salad. This small and popular restaurant is often standing-room-only, with only a handful of tables; most guests pack in at or around the bar. Grab a glass of wine or a beer, peek into the open kitchen, and be sure to check out the futuristic mermaid art on the walls.",Seafood,"655 Divisadero St., San Francisco 94117",37.0,CA,4.3,162,2,10,0,0,37.0,94117
Acquerello,2.0,"With its air of old-world sophistication, Acquerello is the kind of establishment where one dresses for dinner, which is always an occasion. The room feels embellished yet comfortable, with vaulted wood-beamed ceilings, warm terra-cotta walls, and contemporary paintings. It's the kind of place where celebrants of a certain age are happy to splurge on a white truffle-tasting menu. Each prix-fixe here promises expertise and finesse, with a carefully curated wine list to match. Count yourself lucky if your meal begins with a silky parmesan budino topped with micro-herbs and lettuces in vinaigrette, surrounded by fragrant pearls of black truffle gelée. Pastas must not be missed, such as the lobster-filled raviolo in smoked butter-lobster jus. Decadent risotti may arrive topped with Taleggio, velvety egg yolk, compressed radicchio and herbaceous nasturtium leaves to cut the richness. A perfectly pink duck breast with sunflower seed-huckleberry relish, Nantes carrots, and pink peppercorn-duck jus adds just the right note of rusticity. Save room for one of the best mignardises carts you will ever encounter, stocked with superlative house-made chocolates, macarons, pâtes de fruits, and caramels.",Italian,"1722 Sacramento St., San Francisco 94109",112.5,CA,4.5,124,4,54,1,2,112.5,94109
Del Posto,1.0,"In a city like ours, there should be room for all types of restaurants-and that includes those of a more traditional persuasion. The exquisitely attired Del Posto is unashamedly Old School and comes with an expanse of mahogany, acres of marble, and rows of immaculately set tables; you also get a pianist and a veritable army of servers holding down various ranks. In surroundings of such grandeur, it's easy to assume the food will play second fiddle but that would be a mistake because the Italian food here is very good indeed. The menu layout and pricing can be a little bewildering at first but what becomes abundantly clear is that this is a well-orchestrated kitchen and one which demonstrates considerable skill and plenty of genuine care. Fish fin crudo is a great way to start; pasta dishes are surprisingly robust and generously proportioned; and entrées such as lamb with figs come with an awareness of contemporary tastes. Although pastry chef extraordinaire Brooks Headley has left, his signature desserts remain an immortal highlight on Del Posto's menu. The only thing here you'll find difficult is in believing this place is barely over a decade old.",Italian,"85 Tenth Ave., New York 10011",112.5,NY,4.4,331,4,54,1,1,112.5,10011

A Voce Madison's kitchen has been steadied of late, and its contemporary spirit remains intact.

Its walls are papered with vintage movie posters, while banquettes and tables dominate the dining space. Blaue Gans' strong, loyal following (an increasingly rare feat in the city) is comprised of locals engaging in familiar banter at the bar or communal table. Everyone is here for the impressive Austrian cooking, which may unveil a beautiful bibb, pumpkin seed, and shaved radish salad with a light, creamy pumpkin oil dressing. Other classic treasures include pork Jäger schnitzel with mushrooms, bacon, and herbed spätzle; or classic kavalierspitz accompanied by salty creamed spinach and sweet-tart apple horseradish.

Brasserie Ruhlmann,0.0,"True, some New Yorkers may think of this place as kind of touristy, but this is quintessential brasserie cooking in an equally quintessential Manhattan setting at the base of Rockefeller Center, overlooking its plaza. There is little debate that this French bijou offers some of the best people-watching around. The décor pays homage to its art deco namesake, Émile-Jacques Ruhlmann, through edgy lines and geometric prints. Some dishes may be on the menu more for pleasing the crowds than reflecting tradition (hence the sushi rolls). Still, the croque monsieur is everything you dream it to be-impossibly rich with paper-thin and salty jambon de Paris, creamy béchamel, and a dangerously good layering of melted Gruyère over thick slices of brioche.",French,"45 Rockefeller Plaza, New York 10111",62.0,NY,3.8,39,3,44,0,0,37.0,10111

With their fantastic menu, killer margaritas, and dedication to hospitality, El Parador is worthy of its status as a beloved destination. The intimate space is decked with ornate wood chairs, red banquettes, and wood plank ceilings, while white brick walls are hung with artwork and artifacts. The bountiful menu offers favorites like taco trays and nachos in three varieties, as well as a rotating menu of daily specials (be sure to try the fish of the day). Fill up on aguachile de camaron, deliciously classic shrimp ceviche in lime juice and jalapeño; or tender, falling-off-the-bone baby-back ribs served with tequila-chili guajillo salsa, cabbage slaw, and braised camote.

That oven not only provides a heartwarming welcome and sets the whitewashed interior aglow, but it is also responsible for baking the incredible plank of bread that is alone worth a trip here. Bring friends because this midtown marvel's recently revised menu is best enjoyed by grazing the zesty meze like house-made scallop and crab sausage shakshooka with poached quail egg, or wild mushroom bread pudding with creamy talleggio and romesco.

After getting a number (which will be called out in Mandarin, Cantonese, and finally English) and waiting in the inevitable line, settle into a large, circular table along with other diners and prepare for a feast. The fun begins when silver dim sum carts start to roll by, hauling delicacies from the open kitchen. Service is curt as signature temptations such as plump pork dumplings and shrimp rice noodle rolls are plopped onto the table. Chicken with crunchy mustard greens, paired with preserved black beans and a steaming bowl of fluffy white rice is nothing short of heavenly so plan to linger here a while.",Chinese,"813 55th St., Brooklyn 11220",37.0,NY,3.7,91,2,29,0,0,37.0,11220

Italian music plays softly beneath the buzz of this ever-busy restaurant, as loyal crowds wait patiently outside for the piping hot pies topped with melting mozzarella. A deep understanding of the art of bread baking is evident in every pie pulled from the coal-burning oven. The diavola features a tender, black-blistered crust topped with thin slices of spicy-salty salami, light and chunky tomato sauce beneath dollops of mozzarella. Round, square, and even puffy fried pies are all crafted with care at this convivial spot.

Tori Shin,1.0,"When the city's best yakitori decided to up and relocate, its Upper East Side neighborhood suffered a crushing culinary loss-one that would soon become midtown's gain. And after a long construction, Tori Shin is finally welcoming both fresh and familiar faces to its brand-new Hell's Kitchen home. A small bar pouring sake, shochu, and Japanese whiskey welcomes patrons into a multi-level dining room where table seating is now offered in abundance-including a clutch of options in a mezzanine room with gorgeous gold leaf walls. Boasting 500-year old hinoki and a serene palette of sand and stone, this is an upscale, sophisticated spin on the original location. What hasn't changed, however, is the quality of the organically raised chicken parts and the expert skill in which they are sizzled over the binchotan-fired grill. Skewers of crisped wing, seared heart, and creamy liver need nothing more than a few grains of salt to express true flavor. Ordering à la carte is a fun way to explore the menu, which offers grilled vegetables and items like chicken cha-shu in addition to omakase-a succulent onslaught of kara-age, chicken and duck tsukune, blistered shisito peppers, and soboro don.",Japanese,"362 W. 53rd St., New York 10019",62.0,NY,4.4,25,4,55,1,1,112.5,10019

On weekends, the eatery serves traditional desayuno, a gut-bursting feast of chanfainita beef stew, and other hearty favorites. Here, tamales are a broad and flat banana leaf wrapped and stuffed with chicken and olives-a tasty contrast to the familiar Meso-American counterpart. For ultimate comfort, go for the seco de cabrito, a fantastically tender lamb and aji panca stew served with chunks of cassava and extra sauce in a tiny clay kettle.

Muc chien don is a plate of chewy, crisped squid tossed in salt, pepper, and tailed by cucumbers and red onion for ample tang; while the house special pho xe lua reveals a rich, savory broth full of noodles, brisket, and beef tendon.

Though the fragrant herb-loaded lavash presented at each table is good enough to make an entire meal out of, save room for entrées like grilled Scottish salmon, served medium-rare with a colorful, flavorful mélange of beets, cucumber, and black olive tapenade.

Mana may be a tiny spot, but its diverse menu of vegetarian dishes is big on taste-and spice. Korean bibimbap mixes a roster of vegetables like pea pods, roasted carrots, and pickled daikon with a fresh sunny side-up egg; while horseradish and cracked black pepper sneak into macaroni and cheese.

The dining room's tightly packed tables are perfect for grazing, and soaring ceilings along with cathedral windows overlooking Grant Park impress locals and out-of-towners alike. Plump, crunchy gambas al ajillo are bathed in buttery garlic sauce with a hint of lemon, and servers add to the excitement by drizzling jus over skewers of bacon-wrapped lamb loin medallions at the table.

There's a seasonal dish here to sate every appetite, whether diners are seated at linen-draped tables or perched on sleek stools in the lounge area. Bar bites offer upscale indulgences like bison sliders tucked into bone marrow-buttered focaccia, while a dual preparation of tartares-yellowfin tuna with Moroccan olives complementing Scottish salmon with charred red onion-could be a meal on its own.

Paramount's menu features dishes that make the most of top-quality ingredients, like a plump burger crafted from 100 percent Wagyu beef on a toasted brioche bun.

When a utilitarian and self-consciously bare interior seems modern and industrial. When temporarily disconnected phone lines and full mailboxes make every hipster in the room feel like he hit the jackpot to score this reservation. The booming hip-hop peppered with expletives reflects the deeply talented chefs' ethos, going well beyond laissez-faire to reach the point of ""we don't give a damn."" That said, you probably won't either. The food really is that good. The 14-course nightly tasting has no menu really to speak of, but there are plenty of tattooed servers ready to describe each dish with details that come at you rapid fire. While some courses may seem way out of balance in terms of flavor and textural complexity, others have been known to show nuance and delicacy-as evident in the smooth and fine Osetra caviar sitting in a mélange of cashew nut purée, tender hearts of palm, and fried plantain chips; or a single quail egg raviolo with its glossy and unctuous brown butter sauce.

The casual menu features a dozen varieties of red or white pizzas, along with antipasti and desserts for those who need more than a pie.

Walk past a sliding door to enter this elegant, terra cotta-lined dining room, which feels worlds away from the fiesta upfront. Lunch is notably laid-back, but chatty, over-eager servers turn dinner into a more exhaustive experience. Enduring their descriptive chalk talk may feel a bit like sitting through a college lecture for some, but be patient as you will be rewarded with exceptional food boasting a panoply of flavors, colors, and textures. A trio of ceviches highlighting albacore, tomato, and olive; Yucatecan shrimp and calamari; and tuna coctel make for divine starters. And, the sopa seca de fideos, tossed in a saucy tomato-morita broth and fortified by chorizo, crema, and Brussels sprouts, is perhaps the best in the country. Desserts are flagrantly inventive and the strongest element of this epicurean show.

Beyond the discreet exterior, find an intimate lounge with a spotlit and vivid blue sculpture. Decorative branches and net curtains divide the cavernous space; while white walls adorned with Warhol lithographs lend a luxe-gallery feel. Leather and velvet banquettes surrounding well-spaced tables are popular for quiet gatherings or romantic interludes. The variety of dining options begins with an excellent prix-fixe, extending all the way up to a deep-pocketed caviar selection. However, the menu fulfills its literal promise of exploring Chef Anthony Martin's very modern kitchen. Superlative talent is abundantly clear in the smooth and silky foie gras covered in a thin shell of sugar and counterbalanced by segments of blood orange. Succulent and pearly white halibut is seared to perfection and seasoned with a warm, chive-infused cream sauce, while Berkshire pork is the center of an impeccable presentation of ""petit vegetables"" including brilliantly crisp and tender peas.

Flickering candles and wood accents make it feel like a remote forest lodge, and a quote from Chaucer over the wine rack enhances the overall historic feel. Both the reasonably priced à la carte and fixed menus appear simple, listing one or two main seasonal ingredients often repeated with new insight throughout a meal. However, each dish elevates farm-to-table cooking with creative exploration. This is at once clear in the ""egg, bacon,"" its velvety yolk ready to spill over and lushly sauce the roasted rapini, bacon confit, and dark slice of toasted pumpernickel beneath. This may be followed by pearly white fluke set over deep-green kale braised with bacon and paired with shards of crisped kale, juice-like kale foam, as well as bacon bits, purple potato slices, sweet apple balls, toasted hazelnuts, and a single, succulent Gulf shrimp.

Everest,1.0,"Summit the historic Chicago Stock Exchange building via a private elevator to reach the sophisticated-though not outdated-scene at Everest on the 40th floor. The sunken-level dining room stays dimly lit by contemporary circular metal light fixtures, all the better to gaze admiringly at the views from the windows framing the formal space. Heavy white linens and abstract bronze sculptures adorn each table, at which smartly-dressed guests take it all in. Alsatian chef Jean Joho keeps to the French tradition on his degustation and prix-fixe menus, with nods to local ingredients among the classical techniques and pairings presented nightly. Where other chefs may feel the need to update and tweak time-honored dishes, Everest celebrates its classics. Subtle hints of ginger in a rich Gewürztraminer butter sauce complement succulent chunks of fresh Maine lobster. Two thick, bone-in lamb chops, ringed elegantly with flavorful fat, are tender but never too chewy, their richness amplified by delicate, silken spring garlic flan and a bed of crisp green beans that soak up the thyme jus.

But with much better food.The chive buttermilk biscuit is a distinctive, flaky force to be reckoned with. Clear Southern flavors are further explored with sour pickles and thick slices of green tomatoes both dredged in cornmeal and deep-fried to piping hot perfection, served with buttermilk dressing, avocado salad, tomato jam, and hatch chile salsa.

Pylos,0.0,"Restaurateur Christos Valtzoglou has found the winning formula with this longstanding hideaway. Although his Heartbreak and Boukies may be faded memories, Pylos continues to sparkle as brightly as the Aegean Sea on a summer day. Taking its name from the Greek translation of ""made from clay,"" this contemporary taverna features a ceiling canopy of suspended terra-cotta pots dressing up a room with whitewashed walls and lapis-blue insets. Pale-green stemware and stark white crockery are used to serve Greek wines and a menu of rustic home-style cooking. Gigantes are baked in honey-scented tomato-dill sauce; grilled marinated octopus is drizzled with balsamic reduction; and anginares moussaka is a creamy vegetarian take on the classic made with artichokes.",Greek,"128 E. 7th St., New York 10009",37.0,NY,4.5,150,3,48,0,0,37.0,10009
The Breslin,1.0,"Not sure you've come to the right place? Just look for those new media hotties climbing out of black cars, and know that you've arrived at The Breslin. Attached to the markedly hip Ace Hotel, this uber-stylish gastropub, known for its pretty patrons and perpetual buzz, is a place to see and be seen. Booths tucked into nooks on one side of the room are by far the best seats in the house, but all is not lost if you can't nab one. Close-knit tables adorned with white china and rustic wooden boards are equally inviting, with views of the open kitchen. If your welcome was a bit...well lukewarm...you'll find that the tee- and tattoo-donning staff warms up as service progresses-not unlike one's appreciation for the chef's outstanding creations. Parmesan and fried parsley leaves gild the romaine in a delicious, very garlicky Caesar salad; just as a coiled link of terrifically flavored merguez is perfectly finished with smoky Marcona almond aïoli. Meanwhile, warm and milky burrata gains great flavor and texture when kissed by nutty hazelnut pesto. Clementine cake frosted with mascarpone and dates is a sweet example of how this kitchen elevates seemingly simple eats to thoroughly stellar treats.",Gastropub,"16 W. 29th St., New York 10001",62.0,NY,4.2,347,3,18,1,1,62.0,10001

So, reserve ahead as every seat is filled-from the festive bar up front right down to those fun two-tops sporting blazing grills. Make no mistake-this is no average K-town joint. Inside, a top-notch venting system lets diners enjoy a smoke-free evening of exceptional grilled meats. Start wtih deep-fried pork mandu, which are crisp, on-point, and extra divine. Wonderfully flaky buchu gochu pajeon is studded with chives for perfect flavor; while pork belly marinated in red wine is smoky and supremely tender. For the ultimate payoff, opt for the memorable beef platter featuring thinly sliced macun and yangneuym galbi set beside king trumpet mushrooms-meaty and mouthwatering in their own right.",Korean,"17 E. 32nd St., New York 10016",37.0,NY,4.2,109,2,58,0,0,37.0,10016

Dinnertime brings a mellower vibe, and a crowd of beer- and sake-sipping patrons ordering tasty plates of spicy fried chicken and yakitori galore. Midday features several varieties of lunch sets. Tasty appetizers may unveil a salad of assorted pickles and simmered daikon in a sweet ginger dressing. Skip over the fried seafood in favor of the soba totto gozen set, which includes the wonderful soba in fragrant dashi; or try one of the many delicious dons topped with tasty tidbits like sea urchin and salmon roe or soy-marinated tuna, grated yam, and egg.",Japanese,"211 E. 43rd St., New York 10017",37.0,NY,4.2,97,3,55,0,0,62.0,10017

The setting is clean and simple (think Korean barbecue hall) and the staff genuinely warm and friendly, but the lip-smacking roster of classics is the real draw here. Past the lineup of terrific bi bim baps, don't miss the excellent mandu, fried to perfection and piped with tender pork and vegetables; or japchae, a sweet potato noodle stir fry; or one of the restaurant's increasingly popular lunch specials-imagine a refreshing bowl of naengmyeon served in icy cold broth.",Korean,"35 W. 35th St., New York 10001",37.0,NY,4.0,85,2,58,0,0,37.0,10001

Come during the day and you'll witness Corporate America at lunch-and they clearly appreciate the efficiency with which it's run. The menu offers enough choice to satisfy the most demanding of sea dogs: there are oysters and lobsters, classics and more contemporary offerings; there are dishes for two like salt-baked mackerel or paella and, for those who fancy themselves as hunter-gatherers, whole fish.",Seafood,"120 W. 49th St., New York 10020",62.0,NY,4.3,131,3,91,0,0,37.0,10020

The slender setting is adorned with silk-lined walls, sleek leather seating, and evocative artwork. The well-dressed staff is serious, but their hospitality is genuine. The team of highly experienced co-chefs is equally intense in turning out their skilled cooking. Antipasti might include an elegant, warm octopus salad with baby artichoke and crispy potatoes, while heartier options may feature house-made cavatelli with jumbo crabmeat and sea urchin.

Although it's spacious with plenty of outdoor options, the popular spot doesn't accept reservations-and has the lines to prove it. Executive Chef/partner Neil Kleinberg (also of downtown fave Clinton St. Baking Company) turns out joyful fare, and the weekly blueberry pancake special is just one reason why this place gets so much love. For lunch, a kale salad with artichoke hearts, pickled carrots, and crispy chickpeas is anything but rote.

The pretty space is illuminated with jewel-toned votives and boasts a cement floor inlaid with oak, straw seat chairs, and exposed brick. Beyond this, the chef puts her impressive experience to work in the open kitchen. The house-made pappardelle is a perfect example of Miranda's unique approach: the wide delicate strands of pasta clutch on to bits of slow-cooked lamb in a dark, earthy, mole tasting of dried chilies, sweet spices, and bitter chocolate.

Here, the staff speaks their mother tongue for the most part, incense wafts from an altar, and the food is otherworldly. Dishes present dazzling, authentic flavors, easily savored in the peaceful atmosphere. Sweet, head-on shrimp arrive steamed and still in the shell, housing juice that accentuates the concentrated flavor when dipped in soy sauce. Likewise, the stinky tofu (a traditional delicacy) gets its flavor from a light sauté and a finish of kimchi-style pickles. And if you're any sort of fan of the famed oyster pancake, this outstanding version will remain in your memory long after the lengthy ride home.",Chinese,"59-14A Main St., Flushing 11355",18.5,NY,4.0,29,1,29,0,0,18.5,11355

The time-tested combination of wheezing accordion music, white linens, tile floors, and pastoral murals makes it all the rage among diners craving the familiar-and a $30 lunch prix-fixe doesn't hurt either. From escargots and steak tartare to bouillabaisse and steak frites, Chef/owner Jean-Claude Poilevey nails the classic bistro dishes. Don't miss the steak haché, a patty of excellent ground beef seared to perfection, then topped with smoked goat cheese and plated with truffle-laced Bibb lettuce, a thick slice of maple bacon, and crunchy fried onion rings.",French,"111 N.

Spiaggia,1.0,"This modern bi-level dining room showcases subdued shades of gray, an intricately tiled marble floor, and spacious seating that only money can buy. Its views of the lake and Magnificent Mile are just as priceless. Glass ""caves"" for wine and cheese, and charcuterie served at the bar whet the appetite. The kitchen reflects its elegant surrounds in treating each meticulously sourced ingredient with care, respect, and talent. Modern twists are clear throughout the menu, yet Spiaggia remains a very classic Italian restaurant. This is immediately evident in pasta courses such as the springy and resilient fresh tajarin; the thin and pale yellow noodles are twirled with a none-too-buttery sauce and generous shaving of fragrant white truffles. ""Little hats"" or cappelletti are stuffed with duck confit, leeks, and Parmigiano, then served in a rich duck consommé amid poached egg and dehydrated hen of the woods mushrooms. Venison with white truffles, chestnut purée, and tart macerated mulberries is amazingly delicate on all levels.

It is likewise true to its downtown spirit, in a room that features dim lighting and exposed brick prettied with chalk drawings of orchids and water lilies. The personable staff and menu of Southeast Asian delights are as steady as the constant crowd. Popular choices include roti telur, a thin and slightly crisped yet pliable pancake stuffed with scrambled eggs, onions, and peppers, paired with fragrant chicken curry and coconut dipping sauce. The nasi lemak is a dome of coconut rice surrounded with sweet chili shrimp, hard-boiled egg, roasted peanuts, and dried anchovies for mixing into an outrageously good mélange of Malaysian flavors.",Asian,"15 E. 17th St., New York 10003",37.0,NY,4.1,154,2,64,0,0,37.0,10003

Print's home, off the lobby of the Ink48 hotel, has an easy-breezy layout that unites lounging and supping in a space that is pleasantly moody and particularly cozy. The talented team behind this locavore kitchen takes its mission seriously: there is a full time forager on payroll, water is poured into recycled glasses, the kitchen composts, and the menu highlights the provenance of ingredients. Seasonality and simplicity are shown in creations like a wintertime salad of watercress, blood orange, Medjool dates, crushed Marcona almonds, and sherry vinaigrette.

This aptly-named hit offers a relaxed vibe for a light lunch, cocktails at the bar, dinner on the patio, and everything in between. Surprisingly hearty dishes like chicory salad tossed with sliced fennel and fines herbes vinaigrette won't leave you craving meat, nor will the gourmet Wagon Wheel grilled cheese with braised greens and chanterelle mushrooms.

Beyond the butcher case, a selection of satisfying Francophile classics keeps the sophisticated Chicago contingent returning to this cozy, stylish standby. Tradition reigns in the kitchen, where the emphasis is on flavorful and unpretentious dishes like seafood pot-au-feu bobbing with scallops and pepper-crusted cod fillet in a tasty fennel broth. Pickled cornichons and warm toast points make a meal out of house-made country pâté. And for an indulgent finish, split a plate of warm caramel-drizzled pineapple crêpes.",French,"2300 N.

From aromatic, homemade curries to tasty twists on dahls (turka dahl ki shabzi is a revelation), everything is fresh and fragrant. Bengali fish curry is a notable attraction-its flavors mild yet lively with mustard seeds, firm and fresh green beans, and silky-sweet onions.

This multi-floor arena, with its pretty price tags, clubby décor, and a well-stocked bar, is one of the Bronx's better-kept secrets. Servers are personable and very professional. Mussels fra diavolo features meaty mollusks tossed in spicy marinara and paired with crunchy garlic crostini. Porterhouse for two is tender, perfectly marbled, cooked to exact specification, and even better when accompanied by creamy mashed cauliflower flecked with cracked pepper, cheddar, and crispy bacon bits.

The décor follows suit with a ceiling comprised of a backlit reed canopy, twig-like fixtures, and unadorned wood tables. This is a place for celebrants as well as serious foodies. Warm and very competent servers explain dishes with the same painstaking detail and dexterity that the kitchen uses to place carrot jerky onto its mossy twig. Chef Dominique Crenn's cooking is at once whimsical and deeply accomplished, based on elemental expressions of the earth or sea. While the idea of ""poetic culinaria"" may seem self-indulgent to some, this cuisine is undeniably authentic, deeply personal, and filled with brilliant grace notes of flavor and creativity. Expect dishes that are light yet complex, such as fluke that seems ready to melt over tarragon ice, amid droplets of creamy smoked sturgeon, sea-cucumber dashi, and pickled Asian pears. Dark and intense spot prawn broth is so deeply flavored that it seems like you are tasting shellfish for the first time.

The interior bears a Mediterranean sensibility, with idyllic murals of the Spanish countryside, dark wood tables, and huge vessels of refreshing sangria. It has the feel of a relic from another time, when attentive service and a polished dining room were standard. Familiar flavors abound, as in sardinas a la plancha, two fat Portuguese sardines simply grilled and served with a wedge of lemon. The hearty paella Valenciana sees lobster claws, mussels, smoky chicken, chorizo, clams, and roasted peppers folded into a mound of sultry rice.

A tad Americanized but completely delicious, here you will find tasty noodles, sour soups, and refreshing iced coffee. A terrific massaman curry with chicken, potatoes, and lotus root offers the perfectly balanced flavors and spice one expects in Thai cooking, blending lemongrass and Kaffir lime with sharp chilies and smooth coconut milk.

Turkish options are few and far between in this predominately Orthodox neighborhood, and dishes here reflect this mergence of ethnicities, as in the unexpected but appealing combination of hummus topped with pastrami.

Opening this culinary show are pickled cucumbers and briny bamboo shoots with mushrooms, followed by pan-seared lamb dumplings or hugely fortifying ""Dial oil"" noodles sautéed with dried red chilies.

For the uninitiated, the setup is simple: you walk in, wait for a seat at one of the few tables that run the length of the room, and order from an ever-changing menu filled with delights.

Predictably, steakhouse and raw bar standards dominate the menu. Most steaks are wet-aged, and though some may prefer more funk, the cuts are expertly broiled.

The place has an unapologetically masculine look thanks to the mahogany paneling and dark leather seating.

Come hungry for slow-smoked brisket with a spicy and inspired rub that's straight out of Austin. Hard to find outside the state, the Hill Country specialty of deep-fried turkey tails is especially tender, served over porky collard greens and salty-sweet cornbread with pepper jelly.

Pasta here can be at once luxurious and comforting, as in the cavatelli topped with rabbit and pancetta ragù with smoky-sweet cipollini.

But seafood rules after breakfast, when the raw bar spouts oysters, clams, sea urchin, as well as bright Mediterranean white wine. The menu presents culinary hedonism at its finest, like mussel toast: plump mollusks, paprika, and caper aïoli spread over crunchy sourdough bread.

Regulars perch at the bar to watch the 'tender whip up a cocktail or classic egg cream, while serious diners find a seat and get noshing on hot- and cold-smoked Scottish salmon teamed with potato crisps. The result? A thrilling contrast in flavor and texture. Caramelized chocolate babka French toast is crowned with strawberries for a sweet-savory treat; and ""eggs Benny"" with salmon, spinach, and challah never fails to peg a bruncher.",Deli,"127 Orchard St., New York 10002",37.0,NY,4.5,162,2,57,0,0,37.0,10002
Gregory's 26 Corner Taverna,0.0,"Judge a book by its cover and miss the rustic pleasures found within this old-fashioned Greek taverna. Disheveled charm fills the tiny two-room interior, festooned with Greek flags, bunches of artificial grapes, and framed countryside scenes. The bare tables are topped with butcher paper and the service is slow as molasses, but the cooking is honest and intensely flavorful. Begin with tirokafteri, a spicy, satisfying spread of thick feta blended with pickled red chili peppers and served with hot pita points. A stuffed green horn pepper might be next, over a bed of fried squash slices and a well of garlicky scordalia. The seafood combo offers the simple pleasures of stuffed clams, mussels, lobster, and shrimp with lots of butter, lemon, and parsley...Greek style!",Greek,"26-02 23rd Ave., Astoria 11105",37.0,NY,4.4,25,2,86,0,0,37.0,11105
The Progress,0.0,"The sequel to mega-popular State Bird Provisions, located right next door, has retained all of its sibling's inventiveness while moving things forward (hence the name) in a more restrained, elegant way. Set in a 100-year-old former theater, the retro-industrial space is a real looker, with attentive, thoughtful service and exceptional wine and cocktails to boot. Diners are encouraged to team up to savor the ""choose-your-own-adventure"" feast, which allows a choice of six courses from a list of about 20. The enticing array of dishes includes ""potstickers"" filled with triple-cream cheese and peas, spice-rubbed grilled squab with salted chili paste, and earthy poppy-seed cake with mascarpone, pistachio paste, and strawberries for dessert.",Contemporary,"1525 Fillmore St., San Francisco 94115",62.0,CA,4.6,65,4,23,0,0,62.0,94115
Aatxe,0.0,"The name is pronounced ""ahh-chay"" and the food is pronounced ""delicious"" at this Spanish charmer, where pintxos like boquerones with green olive, smoked salmon deviled eggs, and chanterelle croquetas taste straight out of San Sebastián. Keep it classic with shrimp al ajillo, bathed in sizzling garlic-chili oil, or try the adventurous ""Spanish fried rice,"" a take on paella packed with smoky chorizo, tender cuttlefish, and nuggets of tortilla Española. Set in the historic Swedish-American Hall, the small, modern art-packed space has an open kitchen and a thumping, clubby vibe-it's not the place for quiet conversation. But thanks to the well-curated menu of gin and tonics (a Spanish favorite), it's ideal for letting loose and having fun.",Spanish,"2174 Market St., San Francisco 94114",37.0,CA,4.1,35,3,98,0,0,37.0,94114
Lord Stanley,1.0,"You'll feast like a very refined lord at this outstanding newcomer, which, like its husband-and-wife chef/owners, is half Californian, half European. The West Coast vibe comes from the outstanding local ingredients and airy, light-flooded contemporary space, while across-the-pond touches (both chefs trained in the UK) include tip-free dining with all-inclusive dish prices and an intriguing wine list offering unusual Eastern European vintages. Like its space, Lord Stanley's food is approachably refined, with stunning creations like a summer squash tart with almonds, summer squash, and herb aïoli. Silky black cod, pan-seared in butter and served in a spicy fava bean- and avocado-studded broth, is a showstopper. Even a seemingly simple dessert of grilled peaches with white Lillet sorbet and fruity olive oil gets an intriguing touch from slivers of Castelvetrano olives that add just the right amount of vibrancy. In keeping with its San Franciscan ethos, Lord Stanley is a laid-back spot: the crowd of yupster couples often arrives on foot to the central Polk Street location, attired in casualwear. Be sure to quiz the attentive staff on the dishes-they'll happily explain each intricate layer.",Californian,"2065 Polk St., San Francisco 94109",62.0,CA,4.2,26,4,41,1,1,62.0,94109
Longbranch Saloon,0.0,"The wonders of whiskey are on full display at this relatively recent gastropub, which stocks a sizable selection of Bourbon, Scotch, and rye. If you're new to the brown elixir, never fear: well-chosen tasting flights will help you gain proficiency, and the laid-back crew of locals is engaging, never snobby. The kitchen's signatures are worthy of the bar's spirits selection, which explains why the space fills quickly with a local crowd. Order up a cocktail and half-dozen Tomales Bay oysters with mignonette. Then tuck into the hearty bangers and mash featuring a juicy house-made white sausage and buttery potato purée. Lighter appetites will love the asparagus sformato, a custardy, savory pudding accompanied by a tangy fennel salad with pickled grapes.",Gastropub,"2512 San Pablo Ave., Berkeley 94702",37.0,CA,4.3,29,2,23,0,0,37.0,94702
Outerlands,0.0,"For the residents of this foggy beachside community, this new hotspot is an ideal hangout. The salvaged wood-dominated décor is perfectly cozy, and all-day hours ensure crowds flock here for breakfast and Bloody Marys to start their day. A friendly staff, good, locally roasted coffee, and a nicely stocked bar with a fine listing of beers on tap persuade further lingering. Stop in for fresh baked pastries like coffee cake, scones, and glazed doughnuts; or dig into heartier fare like an open-faced sandwich topped with black eye pea purée, green tomato, and griddled ham slices. Once the sun sets over Ocean Beach, expect more ambitious cooking from the dinner menu, like smoked chicken with tomato panzanella and charred gem lettuce.",American,"4001 Judah St., San Francisco 94122",37.0,CA,4.3,235,2,2,0,0,37.0,94122
398 Brasserie,0.0,"Skip the Union Square tourist traps and head for this newcomer in the Hotel G, where the French-accented fare is a step up from the neighboring options. Distressed pillars and ceiling panels give the interior a demolition-chic vibe, but contemporary chandeliers, sleek furniture, and a gleaming exhibition kitchen make the chaos feel flashy, not funky. The cocktail crowd descends early here, and for good reason: the drinks are outstanding, and pair well with the kitchen's Euro-American cuisine. Try the classic Lyonnaise salad of frisée, poached egg, crisp bacon lardons, and duck prosciutto, or the tender duck confit with cremini mushroom fricassee. If it's available, the wood-roasted calamari with smoked peppers and chorizo is not to be missed.",French,"398 Geary St., San Francisco 94012",62.0,CA,3.2,35,4,44,0,0,112.5,94012
Izakaya Rintaro,0.0,"Delicate izakaya cuisine with a produce-centric NorCal sensibility awaits at this Japanese newcomer, which transforms even the most humble dishes into art. Freshly made soft tofu is infused with fragrant bergamot peel, while meaty king trumpet mushrooms join classic chicken thighs and tender tsukune on the menu of smoky, caramelized charcoal-grilled skewers. The blancmange, infused with white sesame and topped with sweet black soybeans, is particularly unmissable. Housed in the former Chez Spencer, which was destroyed in a fire, Rintaro has kept its predecessor's gorgeous (and charred) arched ceiling beams, but added a delicate, wood-framed bar and booths. The result is a serene environment perfect for sharing and sampling the exquisite food.",Japanese,"82 14th St., San Francisco 94103",37.0,CA,4.8,56,3,55,0,0,62.0,94103
Al's Place,1.0,"Fresh, seasonal vegetables and seafood headline this fantastic new Mission District restaurant, where Chef Aaron London has managed to deftly recast proteins in a supporting role. Straddling a sunny corner, Al's Place sports a bright blue façade and a kind of cheery, seaside, and retro-chic interior where tables are set with kitchen towel napkins and pendant lights glint against the natural light flooding into every corner. The service staff is friendly and attentive, but delightfully unfussy. The restaurant's mix-and-match menu is easily shared, and dishes are light, incredibly flavorful and informal in all the right ways. Chef London combines thought-provoking flavors (think sunchoke with black lime) with ease, layering dimensions you didn't know existed. A soft and creamy plate of burrata finds its match in a coat of crunchy potato chips, and is plated with nutty potato skin mousse, grilled young asparagus, currant soffritto, and Miner's lettuce; while tonarelli is paired with vibrant green garlic purée, citrusy bergamot and briny, grated bottarga. For dessert, don't miss the buttery Meyer lemon tart, studded with sweet strawberries and paired with creamy lavender ice cream.",Californian,"1499 Valencia St., San Francisco 94110",37.0,CA,4.6,76,2,2,1,1,37.0,94110
Paprika,0.0,"Diners who set foot into Paprika, named for one of the most essential spices in Eastern European cooking, should prepare to feel as if they've been transported to Prague. It's a simple, no-frills, cash-only kind of place, but cheerful service, affordable fare, and a vast selection of European draft beers make for a relaxed, enjoyable atmosphere. The small menu manages to cover all the bases, from tender, well-seasoned pork goulash packed with sweet tomatoes, caramelized onions, garlic, and zippy paprika, to a smoky, blistered Polish kielbasa over creamy mashed potatoes and paprika-infused gravy (you'll want some bread to soak up every last drop of this). Snag a table at one of the bay windows, then settle in to enjoy your meal with a stein of beer, of course.",Eastern European,"3324 24th St., San Francisco 94110",18.5,CA,3.6,23,2,103,0,0,18.5,94110
Los Cilantros,0.0,"If there's no Mexican grandma in your life, Los Cilantros will show you what you've been missing: homey, authentic south-of-the-border fare (and if there is, it might just give her a run for her money). Whether you're biting into a crunchy tostada topped with chipotle chicken, black beans, sour cream, and avocado, or savoring rustic chicken enchiladas in a tangy green chile-tomatillo salsa, this is comfort food at its best. Cute and simple, the Berkeley newbie features tiled floors, pops of yellow and orange, and colorful paintings by Mexican artists. Settle in at one of the wooden tables and let the gracious staff make you feel right at home, or, if the weather's nice, grab a seat on the tiny front patio and catch some rays.",Mexican,"3105 Shattuck Ave., Berkeley 94705",18.5,CA,4.0,12,1,66,0,0,18.5,94705
Staropolska,0.0,"Fans of traditional Polish cooking know to proceed to this Logan Square mainstay. If a stroll past nearby Kurowski's Sausage Shop doesn't put you in the mood for some meaty, belly-busting cuisine, then one step inside this Old World-style sanctum certainly will. Polish pilsners and lagers are poured at the bar and pair perfectly with the stuffed and slow-cooked plates sent out by the kitchen. Pierogies are a staple, and are offered here with a variety of sweet and savory embellishments. Stuffed cabbage is available with a meatless mushroom filling, and house specialties include the placek po wegiersku: a light and tender griddled potato pancake folded over chunks of pork and bell pepper slices, braised in a tomato and sweet paprika sauce.",Polish,"3030 N.

Charlatan,0.0,"Despite what its moniker might suggest, Charlatan is in fact a genuine and authentic show of talent. Hip and comfortable, this gastropub boasts whimsical toile and velvet details, a trio of mounted animal heads, and quality fare that puts the average pub grub to shame. The menu is anchored by a number of inventive pastas prepared in-house, like charred fennel-stuffed tortellini bobbing in a boldly seasoned porchetta brodo hit with fennel pollen and garlic-mustard oil. Unbelievably tender grilled octopus is plated with beef-braised carrots and fried bone marrow-enriched romesco; and the honeycomb-topped chocolate tart tastes as silky as a bowl of pudding. To make the most of your meal, wash it all down with a local brew or wine from a small producer.",Mediterranean,"1329 W. Chicago Ave., Chicago 60642",37.0,IL,4.2,29,2,54,0,0,37.0,60642
The Duck Inn,0.0,"Grab a taxi and head to the warehouses of Bridgeport, where this stylish, modern tavern-from neighborhood native Kevin Hickey-feels like a diamond in the rough. Through a set of French doors, the hubbub brought on by intricate cocktails in the retro globe-lit lounge leads to a decorous dining room with wide wooden tables and curvy midcentury seating. Beyond the kitchen's signature rotisserie duck for two, the menu spreads its wings with a focused but diverse selection of small plates and entrées. Briny sea beans are the crowning touch to a winning dish of uni butter-slathered spot prawns and creamy risotto, while a duo of pickle- and beer-brined chicken thigh and drumstick glisten with a tableside finish of smoked paprika jus.",American,"2701 S.
