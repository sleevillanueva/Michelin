Anteprima,0.0,"Nestled into a vibrant strip of shops and eateries, this family-friendly gem is set apart by smart plate-glass windows and olive green-tinted woodwork. Inside, rusticity rules the roost with pressed-tin ceilings and intricate wood paneling. It's the kind of place where even solo patrons feel welcome, especially when perched on a window seat overlooking the bustling street. Following its moniker, diners should ""preview"" the wide-ranging menu before opting for such delights as grilled sardines with sweet fennel, fragrant herbs, and fine olive oil. Delicious pastas include homemade ravioli-filled with a blend of crushed peas and mint-finished with a light, parmesan-flecked sauce. For dessert, a rich, well-made panna cotta wobbles with lemon syrup and zest.",Italian,"5316 N. Clark St., Chicago 60640",37.0,IL,"4.1

Alinea,3.0,"Who needs a meal followed by a show when you can have both together? That's because eating at Alinea, which involves around 20 courses over about three hours, is more than simply dinner-it's culinary theater. Perhaps it could qualify for a Tony Award along with its Michelin stars, because you're even invited backstage afterwards to meet the talented protagonists in the kitchen. Alinea provides such a vivid, visceral experience, that you'll even forget about the somewhat painful and entirely inhospitable booking procedure. Neophytes have nothing to fear here as there's a veritable army of charming, clued-up helpers and servers to guide you effortlessly through each and every dish. And guidance is certainly needed because the only menu you'll see is the one presented to you like an award certificate as you leave. The cooking is strikingly original and very clever. It can surprise but it can also challenge; at times dishes can be playful or even whimsical. But underpinning all those clever techniques and all those dazzling arrangements and quite striking presentations is an inherent understanding of flavor-and this is what gives the cooking such great depth.",Contemporary,"1723 N.

Atwood,0.0,"This corner restaurant's 19th century façade may be historic, but its soaring dining room is a strikingly modern vision of white marble-topped tables, glossy beveled subway tiles, and low-slung black leather chairs and banquettes. The crimson bar stools fill with patrons meeting for business and pleasure all week, while brunch gets the place buzzing on weekends. Atwood's brasserie menu isn't exactly full of surprises, but its familiar foods are given first-class upgrades-think pancetta-studded mac and cheese; lamb chops with basil and preserved lemon; and an omelet with crunchy bacon, creamy Brie, and verdant asparagus. For a real wake-up call, the Inferno Virgin Mary has more than enough of a kick (plus more of that bacon as a garnish).",Contemporary,"1 W. Washington St., Chicago 60602",37.0,IL,"4.1

Bistro Campagne,0.0,"The romantic ideal of a French bistro is alive and well at Bistro Campagne. Light slants gently through wooden Venetian blinds, bouncing off cream-and-brick walls in the welcoming dining room. Choose a white cloth-covered table inside, under the red-golden soffit ceiling or outside under twinkling lights and green tree branches in the garden. Inspired accompaniments make for memorable versions of rustic French standards. Meltingly tender foie de veau sparks happy sighs from calves' liver lovers, complemented by crisp bacon and Dijon mustard cream. House-made pappardelle and maitake mushrooms soak up the lavender-infused jus that finishes white wine-braised rabbit.

Boka,1.0,"Housed in an affluent part of town, find a small walkway that leads into this elaborate, handsome, and very sultry dining room. There are three different seating areas and each exudes class with a bit of romance, whimsy, and occasional quirk (note the escutcheon-covered doorway and capricious paintings). Against dark pebbled walls, find oversized horseshoe booths, long banquettes, and mirrored light bulbs casting funky shadows. The semi-outdoor solarium has a living wall of moss and ferns. Servers are friendly and genuine without a hint of pretense. This is the kind of place where one can sink in and not care to leave. Chef Lee Wolen's menu may be modern, but it is widely appealing with a Mediterranean edge. Begin with translucent slivers of fresh sea bass that get a pleasant chew from almond crumble and perfect flavor from a subtle dab of citrusy yuzu kosho. Then, deliciously tender and evenly pink Colorado lamb is served with a harmonious hodgepodge of creamy yogurt, charred lettuce, and nearly sweet baby potatoes. For dessert, an airy and whipped mound of praline-flavored mousse is set beside milk ice cream, which serves as a cooling counterpoint to the nutty flavors throughout and makes for a fine ending.",Contemporary,"1729 N.

Choose from a litany of salads, sandwiches, and drinks from oversized chalkboard menus behind the counter; then stake out one of the premium second-floor tables. Upstairs, chandeliers, cozy couches, and scattered antiques (not to mention frequent study groups guzzling caffeine and homemade cookies) lend character. Many sandwiches take names from literary works, like The Old Man and the Sea (tuna salad) or Catcher in the Rye (reuben). The muffuletta is a lightly pressed panini rendition of the New Orleans standard, stacking a deli's worth of ham, salami, mortadella, provolone, and mild giardiniera in fresh focaccia for a hearty yet delicate bite.",Deli,"738 W.

Towards the back, leather stools line a long white marble bar, and majestic floor-to-ceiling windows offer views of Magnificent Mile. The menu is solid and approachable Italian-a decidedly less formal alternative to sophisticated older sister, Spiaggia, next door. Kick things off with the piadini, a thin Romagna-style flatbread, grilled and folded around delicious fillings like mortadella, maybe a caprese, or even chicken and honey.

The cozy room features an open kitchen where pie production is on display for all to see. And in a playful bit of recycling, empty tomato sauce cans on each table become stands for sizzling pizzas churned straight from the 800-degree F coal oven. This hot spot has its ratio down to a fine art and knows not to burden its thin, crispy crust that's blackened and blistered in all the right places. The mortadella is a delight, with chopped garlic and gossamer slices of peppercorn-flecked sausage. Care to go your own way?

Convincingly crispy seitan buffalo wings cool down the spice factor with vegan ranch dressing; while flautas filled with mashed potato, faux cheese, and jalapeños are served with tons of flavorful fixings so that the meat is not missed at all.

The all-American menu offers a wide selection of top-notch beef and hearty sides to match. Skewered cubes of maple syrup-smothered, black pepper-dusted bacon are a playful snack to share, a poppable prelude to the carnivorous courses to follow.

If the book-length menu seems overwhelming, scan the list of favorites at the beginning for a quick pick-be sure to avoid any items marked with a chili if you'd rather walk on the mild side. As for the hits, chili oil and peppercorns give numbing heat to crunchy, translucent sheets of beef tendon, and succulent Xinjiang-style cumin lamb is generously coated in cumin seeds and tossed with fresh, zippy ginger.",Chinese,"2172 S.

A retinue of French classics like whole trout Grenobloise are refreshed by seasonal market ingredients at the hands of Chef/co-owner Mary Mastricola. Slices of smoked duck drizzled with black currant vinaigrette get an earthy touch from apple-walnut compote in an elegant lunch salad.

The à la carte menu may offer dishes like duck rillettes spread on a sunflower seed cracker studded with poppy, raw sesame, and pumpkin seeds as well as compressed apple for a tart counterpoint to the rich duck. Meaty abalone mushroom confit is served with tiny and delicate sweet potato tortellini, braised mustard greens, and green apple in a soy-kissed broth.

Muted tones in the exposed brick walls and custom tile flooring complement newer elements like floor-to-ceiling wine storage and dramatic smoke-shaded chandeliers that drip with crystals. Though the décor may tip its hat to yesteryear, Chef Andrew Zimmerman's cuisine is firmly grounded in the 21st century. Whether you visit for lunch or dinner, meals here always seem to reflect the amalgam of American cuisine, with hints of Southeast Asian, Korean, and Mediterranean tastes. Potato gnocchi may seem commonplace, but this version is memorable thanks to the flawless components and rich, profound flavors of lamb sugo with crunchy bits of ciabatta breadcrumbs.

The historic spot, founded in 1941, is boisterous downstairs with the aforementioned regulars and guys grabbing a bite; upstairs is more refined for local politico lunches and a bit of old-school romance at dinner. Gene & Georgetti is a steakhouse with an Italian bloodline, prominently displayed in the heaping helping of fried peperoncini and bell peppers with the signature ""chicken alla Joe."" The cottage fries (oversized potato planks that come with most entrées) might necessitate a doggie bag, but all the better to leave room for a slice of classic carrot cake.",Steakhouse,"500 N.

Inside, they are welcomed by a palette of rich, cool hues, crystal-beaded light fixtures that hang overhead, and an open kitchen boasting a wood-burning oven. Piccolo Sogno's rustic, yet refined menu offers traditional dishes with a twist. A version of the ubiquitous beet salad (both red and golden) is elevated here by shaved fennel, a drizzle of bright citrus oil, and a dollop of creamy, lush buffalo milk ricotta. If you need further encouragement, let us recommend the rabbit.

The extensive small plates menu is primed for pairing with the wine list, and unusual cuts of meat-like a panini with pork heart-take precedence. Inspired by a Chicago beef, this ciabatta roll is moistened with jus, stuffed full of pork, and dressed with sweet peppers and spicy-tangy giardiniera.

A winding staircase leads to a lofty mezzanine. Classic cuts and chops abound, but Rosebud Prime does all of its dishes with panache. Double-cut bone-in lamb chops sport a plump ribbon of fat encircling their delicate, rich centers.

It's a spot that's suited for flirty date nights, boisterous dinners, and every occasion in between. As befits the word ""trattoria,"" rustic Italian preparations take precedence, but the simplicity satisfies. Chunks of pork sausage add heft to a heaping bowl of hand-rolled cavatelli bathed in a light tomato cream sauce, and curls of grilled calamari need only a squirt of lemon, splash of olive oil, and sprinkle of parsley to sing.

Non-traditional menu items might miss the mark here and there, but familiar dishes don't disappoint-and neither do the reasonable prices that pull in crowds of regulars.

Chicago Kalbi,0.0,"Take me out to the ballgame-or the Korean barbecue joint where a ballplayer would feel right at home. At this quirky spot, autographed baseballs line the shelves, while photographs and posters of ballplayers paper the walls. But the cluttered décor doesn't deter locals from frequenting this modest yet welcoming joint. Gas grills at each table give off an intoxicatingly savory perfume as patrons take their time searing their choice of well-marbled marinated beef, including the always-popular bulgogi or kalbi, and then cool their mouths with a traditional array of banchan. For those who prefer their meat raw, beef tartare assumes an interesting twist of flavor and texture when folded with Asian pears, sesame seeds, and sesame oil.",Korean,"3752 W.

A blackboard above the semi-open kitchen lists the fresh daily fish and oyster offerings, ready to be shucked, steamed, fried, and grilled for guests lining up at the wood bar that snakes around the room. The casual menu pays homage to classic coastal fish shacks, yet throws in a few gussied-up items like tartare and octopus à la plancha. Bowls of gumbo stick to the classic recipe with zippy andouille sausage, okra, and chunks of blue crab.

Start with a plump, butter-poached scallop seared until golden, set in a lobster-rich and coconutty sauce with maitake mushrooms and curry spices, surrounded by edible flower petals placed in gels redolent of lemongrass. This may be followed by a unique egg and shell presentation of black garlic custard dotted with shrimp, tucked with an enticingly sharp sprout purée.

Meals here are very conceptual and include head-spinning affairs that articulate a theme, like the ""Faces of Sixteen"" as an homage to inspirations and employees. This may translate as a tribute to Joël Robuchon through a pot of wonderfully smooth, raw and seasoned langoustine artfully topped with gelée and sea buckthorn. Another theme ""Food in Progress, Modern Fine Dining: Moving Forward with Respect to the Past"" ponders the emergence of the Nordic through a gently smoked oyster, flavorful potato gelée, horseradish, and caraway. Grilled lobster with uni, coffee, and rice is downright unforgettable. Desserts like lemon tart with diplomat cream and fennel are as innovative as they are delicious.",Contemporary,"401 N.

Bartenders work just as hard as line cooks until the wee hours. The kitchen puts a highfalutin spin on simple bar eats. In-house butchers craft 32-ounce pork Porterhouses for sharing; foie gras for folding into fluffy scrambled eggs; and house-made sausages for bologna sandwiches that go well beyond a kid's wildest dreams.

Nando Milano Trattoria,0.0,"A corner bar television constantly tuned to (European) football, vintage aperitivo posters, and a welcoming patio tailor-made for afternoon glasses of prosecco: charismatic host Dario Vullo has installed his own little slice of Milan in Wicker Park. The chic trattoria offers an intensely Italian menu and wine list to match the authentic accents of Vullo and family. A trio of arancini are playfully prepared, with each rice ball sporting a unique shape-sphere, triangle, and cube-to denote a special filling like Bolognese ragù and smoked mozzarella; or mascarpone and spinach.

Sharing is recommended for platters like the namesake arroz gordo, a paella-esque blend of meat, shellfish, and pickles.

As per the name, poultry and piscine offerings are house specialties, with signature golden-fried chicken (and equally popular Negroni slushies) on many tables.

Though the food is European-influenced, ingredients from local farms make their way into many dishes. Caraway seeds spice up duck meatballs nestled among springy egg noodles with dehydrated sauerkraut and shaved salted egg yolk, and honeycomb tripe wins new fans when fried to a crisp and topped with house-made giardiniera.

Brindille's menu isn't a sequel to NAHA's contemporary Mediterranean fare, but instead bears a strong Parisian accent influenced by the chef's love of French cuisine. Roasted chestnuts are whirled into a creamy soup and poured over compressed apple, wild mushrooms, and puffed rice.

Bottlefork,0.0,"Bottlefork, Forkbottle-yup, we get it, it's a ""bar & kitchen"" but, in this case, a very good one. The narrow room is dominated by a 40-foot bar which morphs into an open kitchen. The lights are turned down and the music is turned up-and unless they know Big Audio Dynamite, it's not music for kids. When it comes to the food, ""locally sourced and globally inspired"" is their USP with the chef, a Four Seasons alumnus, making much of his largely European peregrinations. Expect punchy flavors, teasing combinations, clever twists, and everything from salumi and tuna crudo in a jar to ""popcorn"" sweetbreads, pastas, and Moroccan stews.

Start with single-serve sake in a jar so cute you'll want to smuggle it home, or a cocktail inspired by Japanese literature (the Norwegian Wood, a delicious interpretation of the Haruki Murakami novel ""Noruwei no Mori,"" blends whiskey, Luxurdo, sweet vermouth, and orange bitters).The array of small plates brims with creativity and flavor: tsukune are coarse-ground, delightfully chewy, and achieve a mouthwateringly charred exterior from having been grilled over bincho-tan; while tako-yaki are as delicious as any found on a Tokyo sidewalk.

A crimson kimchi jjigae broth, seamlessly balanced between sour and spicy, bobs with soft chunks of tofu and pork.

Made from lentils and basmati rice, this lacy crêpe is topped with chunks of tender sunchokes in a spicy red curry sauce sweetened by golden raisins and candied pumpkin seeds.

The no-frills, order-at-the-counter spot is simply adorned, with genuinely welcoming service that only adds to the charm. Every spoonful of Luella's andouille and chicken gumbo is one to remember, thanks to a roux that's been cooked for five (count 'em) hours.

If a stroll past nearby Kurowski's Sausage Shop doesn't put you in the mood for some meaty, belly-busting cuisine, then one step inside this Old World-style sanctum certainly will. Polish pilsners and lagers are poured at the bar and pair perfectly with the stuffed and slow-cooked plates sent out by the kitchen. Pierogies are a staple, and are offered here with a variety of sweet and savory embellishments. Stuffed cabbage is available with a meatless mushroom filling, and house specialties include the placek po wegiersku: a light and tender griddled potato pancake folded over chunks of pork and bell pepper slices, braised in a tomato and sweet paprika sauce.",Polish,"3030 N.

Charlatan,0.0,"Despite what its moniker might suggest, Charlatan is in fact a genuine and authentic show of talent. Hip and comfortable, this gastropub boasts whimsical toile and velvet details, a trio of mounted animal heads, and quality fare that puts the average pub grub to shame. The menu is anchored by a number of inventive pastas prepared in-house, like charred fennel-stuffed tortellini bobbing in a boldly seasoned porchetta brodo hit with fennel pollen and garlic-mustard oil. Unbelievably tender grilled octopus is plated with beef-braised carrots and fried bone marrow-enriched romesco; and the honeycomb-topped chocolate tart tastes as silky as a bowl of pudding. To make the most of your meal, wash it all down with a local brew or wine from a small producer.",Mediterranean,"1329 W. Chicago Ave., Chicago 60642",37.0,IL,"4.2

The Duck Inn,0.0,"Grab a taxi and head to the warehouses of Bridgeport, where this stylish, modern tavern-from neighborhood native Kevin Hickey-feels like a diamond in the rough. Through a set of French doors, the hubbub brought on by intricate cocktails in the retro globe-lit lounge leads to a decorous dining room with wide wooden tables and curvy midcentury seating. Beyond the kitchen's signature rotisserie duck for two, the menu spreads its wings with a focused but diverse selection of small plates and entrées. Briny sea beans are the crowning touch to a winning dish of uni butter-slathered spot prawns and creamy risotto, while a duo of pickle- and beer-brined chicken thigh and drumstick glisten with a tableside finish of smoked paprika jus.",American,"2701 S.
